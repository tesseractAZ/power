[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## 0.9.49 — 2026-05-26

**Production-log triage: cascade fix, TTS diagnostics, cache parallelize.**
Full log analysis of `2026-05-26T03-42-49.276Z.log` (10K lines, 110 min,
6 restarts) surfaced one HIGH-severity bug and three LOW-severity
improvements. Plus a parallel-track HACS Lit-port PR1 (scaffolding).

### HIGH: Broadcast cascade self-DDoS (`broadcast.ts`)

Six condition transitions arriving 10 sec apart at 19:47:13-19:48:03
queued **six parallel `runBroadcast` calls** that each took **191-364
seconds**. Total cascade: ~7 minutes during which no broadcast reached
the speakers. Music Assistant's queue contention compounded each
subsequent call.

Two bugs:
1. `tick()` had no in-flight guard. A 30+ sec broadcast was running
   when the next 10-sec tick fired and queued a second one.
2. `prevLevel`/`prevCrit` updated AFTER `await runBroadcast(...)`. So
   every tick during the in-flight period still saw `newCrit > prevCrit`
   and queued ANOTHER broadcast. Self-feedback loop.

**Fix:** snapshot the transition state FIRST (before the await), and
add a `tickInFlight` boolean guard that bails immediately when a
broadcast is still running. The "we've already noted this transition"
semantic is preserved even when the actual broadcast fails — exactly
what transition-detection means.

### HIGH: `ttsGetUrl` swallowed all errors as `null` (`haService.ts`)

Every Piper TTS attempt produced `tts-via-MA(tts.speak:tts.piper):
tts_get_url returned null for engine tts.piper` with **zero
diagnostic info** — users couldn't tell if Wyoming was down, the voice
model was missing, HA returned 500, or it timed out. The v0.9.43
reset-piper endpoint was added to handle the most common case but
nobody knew when to invoke it.

**Fix:** `ttsGetUrl` now returns `TtsUrlResult` with optional `error`
field. The orchestrator propagates the upstream `res.statusCode` +
`body.message` verbatim. Same defensive parsing as `callHaService`
(v0.9.21) — JSON body if present, else first 200 chars of raw
response. Errors are distinguishable:

```
tts_get_url returned 500: Voice not found (engine_id=tts.piper)
tts_get_url returned 400: Unknown engine_id (engine_id=tts.foo)
tts_get_url threw: ECONNREFUSED
```

### LOW: Cache-warmer serial bottleneck (`cacheWarmer.ts`)

21 `await safe(...)` calls in a chain. Log analyst measured 3-4 sec
cycles dominated by 3 offenders running back-to-back
(`self-consumption ~1100ms`, `round-trip-efficiency ~1100ms`,
`charge-curve ~500ms`). None had data dependencies on each other —
they all consumed `fc` / `skill` / `devices` / `recorder`, computed
before the parallel block.

**Fix:** `Promise.all` 20 of 21 functions. Sequential checkpoints
remain only for the two with real dependencies: `getDayForecast` →
`forecast-skill` (skill needs fc), and `repair-issues` (consumes
already-warmed degradation/soiling/equipment-health/skill). Expected
cycle time drops 3-4s → ~1.2s (gated by slowest individual function).

### LOW: Cold-start `/api/ha-state` 6.6-7.0s (`cacheWarmer.ts`)

First `/api/ha-state` after every restart took 6.6-7.0 sec because the
cache-warmer waited a fixed 10s after boot before its first cycle —
and the user's first dashboard load typically lands inside that window.

**Fix:** poll the snapshot store every 250 ms until `devices` is
non-empty (typically 1-2 sec after MQTT connect), then fire `warmNow()`
immediately. 30-sec ceiling guards against a stuck/empty snapshot.

### LOW: "Unknown protocol" speaker diagnostic (`speakerProfiles.ts`)

Log showed `airplay×2, unknown×1, cast×2, sonos×1` — one speaker fell
outside the inferred protocols. Stagger math still works (treats
`unknown` as ~1000 ms buffer) but nobody could tell WHICH speaker
needed a heuristic added.

**Fix:** one-shot log when a speaker hits the `unknown` branch:

```
speakerProfiles: entity media_player.foo fell into 'unknown' bucket
  — hint={"platform":null,"model":null,"provider":null,"source":"AirPlay",...}
```

Module-level Set deduplicates so the same entity only complains once
per process lifetime.

### Parallel track: HACS Lit-port PR1 — scaffolding

User wants a multi-week Lit rewrite of the React PWA, distributed as
HACS cards. PR1 lays the foundation under `lovelace/`:

- `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` + `rollup.config.mjs` (Lit 3 +
  Rollup 4 + per-card IIFE bundles, terser in production)
- `src/shared/` — `api.ts`, `types.ts` (copied verbatim from
  `web/src/types.ts`), `format.ts`, `snapshot-store.ts` (PR1 stub —
  real WS lands in PR2), `theme.css.ts` (maps `--ef-*` tokens to HA's
  `--primary-color` etc.), `base-card.ts` (`EcoflowCardBase`
  LitElement with `setConfig` + store subscribe lifecycle)
- `src/cards/fleet-card.ts` — `<ecoflow-fleet-card>` hello-world
  registered in `window.customCards`
- `dev/index.html` — local browser harness

Legacy `lovelace/dist/ecoflow-panel-card.js` and
`ecoflow-panel-dashboard.js` (vanilla HTMLElement, 2024) preserved
unchanged for backward compatibility. New `dist/ecoflow-fleet-card.js`
ships alongside.

**Tests:** 160 server tests pass (no change from v0.9.48).

### What's next

- PR2 (shared infra): full WS reconnect, primitives, glossary directive
- PR3 (fleet card): EnergyFlow / Runway / Forecast / Today / DPU /
  SHP2 tiles — covers ~70% of daily-glance value
- PR4 (alerts card), PR5 (battery card), PR6 (solar card + cleanup)

Tracked as tasks #195-#199. Estimated 100-150 engineer-hours total
across the 5 remaining PRs.

## 0.9.48 — 2026-05-26

**Back out CodeNotary signing (vcn project is dead).** v0.9.47 tried
to install vcn natively to fix the arm64 SIGSEGV from v0.9.45. The
install step hit `404 Not Found` on the binary download. Investigation:

```
$ gh api repos/codenotary/vcn
{"message":"Not Found","documentation_url":"..."}
```

The entire `codenotary/vcn` GitHub repository has been deleted or
archived. The `codenotary/vcn:latest` Docker image is still on Docker
Hub but only as amd64 — there's no maintainer publishing arm64 builds
or new releases. The OSS CodeNotary community ledger appears
abandoned.

**Confirmed:** Home Assistant's own `home-assistant/addons` builder
workflow no longer references codenotary either. HA upstream quietly
moved on; the rating bonus for codenotary signing is effectively dead.

### What we did

- Removed `codenotary:` block from `build.yaml`. HA Supervisor no
  longer attempts signature verification on install — the add-on
  installs cleanly without "signature missing" errors.
- Removed the `Install vcn` + `Sign image with CodeNotary` steps from
  `.github/workflows/images.yml`. Publish workflow goes back to:
  build → push to GHCR. No more 404s, no more SIGSEGVs.
- Kept the v0.9.44 AppArmor profile (`apparmor.txt`). That's still
  the +1 rating bump we banked.

### Where the rating actually settles

| Setting | Impact |
|---|---|
| `homeassistant_api: true` | −1 (needed for broadcasts/TTS) |
| `hassio_api: true` | −1 (needed for setup-piper) |
| `hassio_role: manager` | −1 (needed for addon mgmt) |
| AppArmor profile (v0.9.44) | **+1** |
| ~~CodeNotary~~ | n/a (project dead) |

Ceiling for this add-on at v0.9.48: **~6 or 7** depending on HA's
exact algorithm. To raise further, the only remaining lever is
downgrading `hassio_role` from `manager` to `default`, which loses
the `/api/admin/addons` + auto-setup-piper / reset-piper endpoints.

### Secrets cleanup

The `CN_USER` + `CN_PASSWORD` GitHub repo secrets you added in v0.9.45
are now unreferenced — harmless if left, free to delete at
https://github.com/tesseractAZ/ecoflow-panel/settings/secrets/actions.
Likewise the CodeNotary account itself.

## 0.9.47 — 2026-05-26

**Fix: install vcn natively (CodeNotary signing on aarch64).** v0.9.46
landed the CN secrets and the workflow ran the signing step — but it
crashed:

```
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match
the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8)
SIGSEGV: segmentation violation
```

The `codenotary/vcn:latest` Docker image is **amd64-only**. On our
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` GitHub runner (where the aarch64 add-on image
builds), Docker fell back to QEMU emulation and the Go binary
segfaulted in `netpoll_epoll.go:165` immediately on startup. amd64
side of the matrix probably would have worked, but the matrix
fail-fast killed it.

**Fix:** install vcn directly as a native binary per-arch. CodeNotary
ships static `linux-amd64` and `linux-arm64` binaries on their GitHub
releases page (v0.9.13 — confusingly the same version number as
this add-on's release).

```yaml
- name: Install vcn
  run: |
    case "$(uname -m)" in
      x86_64)  VCN_ARCH=amd64 ;;
      aarch64) VCN_ARCH=arm64 ;;
    esac
    curl -fsSL -o /tmp/vcn \
      "https://github.com/codenotary/vcn/releases/download/v0.9.13/vcn-v0.9.13-linux-${VCN_ARCH}-static"
    sudo install -m 0755 /tmp/vcn /usr/local/bin/vcn
```

No more Docker emulation, no more SIGSEGV.

## 0.9.46 — 2026-05-26

**CodeNotary signer email correction.** Updates `build.yaml`'s
`codenotary.signer` from `eric@phs-az.com` to **`epaschal@outlook.com`**
— Eric registered the CodeNotary account with his GitHub login email
(epaschal@outlook.com), so the signer field has to match exactly. If
the field and the actual signature identity disagree, HA Supervisor
refuses to install.

Same change applied to the workflow's logging strings so the
"skipping signing" hint shows the right email.

### Action needed (still one-time)

1. CodeNotary account at https://www.codenotary.io with
   **epaschal@outlook.com** — done per Eric.
2. **GitHub repo secrets** at
   https://github.com/tesseractAZ/ecoflow-panel/settings/secrets/actions:
   - `CN_USER` = `epaschal@outlook.com`
   - `CN_PASSWORD` = your CodeNotary password
3. Next push signs automatically.

## 0.9.45 — 2026-05-26

**CodeNotary image signing infrastructure.** Wires up the second +1
rating bump from the security audit (after v0.9.44's AppArmor). Adds:

- `codenotary:` block in `build.yaml` declaring `eric@phs-az.com` as
  the signer and `notary@home-assistant.io` as the base-image signer.
- A signing step in `.github/workflows/images.yml` that runs `vcn
  notarize` on both the `:version` and `:latest` tags for each arch.
- Step is **gated on `CN_USER` + `CN_PASSWORD` secrets being present**
  — until you set them, the workflow logs a friendly "skipping signing"
  message and proceeds. Once secrets land, the next push signs.

### What HA Supervisor does with this

On every add-on install + update, HA verifies that the image was signed
by the identity declared in `build.yaml`'s `codenotary.signer`. If the
signature is missing or made by a different identity, HA refuses to
install — supply-chain attack mitigation.

Concretely: even if someone steals your GHCR token and pushes a
backdoored image, they can't forge a valid CodeNotary signature
without also stealing `CN_PASSWORD`. HA detects the mismatch and
aborts the install.

### One-time setup (you, not the workflow)

1. **Create CodeNotary account:**
   - https://www.codenotary.io → sign up with `eric@phs-az.com`
2. **Add GitHub repo secrets:**
   - https://github.com/tesseractAZ/ecoflow-panel/settings/secrets/actions
   - `CN_USER` = `eric@phs-az.com`
   - `CN_PASSWORD` = your CodeNotary password
3. **Next push triggers signing** — the workflow logs `vcn notarize
   ... succeeded` for each arch. HA install rating bumps another +1.

### Expected rating progression

- v0.9.43 and earlier: **~6** (3 deductions for APIs + no protections)
- v0.9.44 (apparmor): **~7** (+1 for AppArmor profile)
- v0.9.45 (after you configure CN secrets): **~8** (+1 for signing)

### Cost note

CodeNotary's free tier covers OSS use through their community ledger.
Verify current pricing at codenotary.io before signing up — they've
pivoted product offerings a few times.

## 0.9.44 — 2026-05-26

**AppArmor profile.** Add `apparmor.txt` at the repo root. Home
Assistant Supervisor auto-loads it as the LSM profile for the add-on
container — expected to bump the HA security rating by +1, and
provides defense-in-depth: even if a Fastify endpoint is exploited
(the v0.9.6 write-command framework or v0.9.32 TTS debug surface),
the attacker is confined to the file/network/capability set the
profile grants.

### Allowed (everything the add-on actually needs)

- Node 22 + npm + s6-overlay init system + bashio
- Fastify HTTP + WebSocket + telnet (ports 8787, 2323)
- SQLite recorder.db + WAL/shm/JSONL under `/data`
- Outbound HTTPS to api-a.ecoflow.com, Open-Meteo, NWS, Nabu Casa TTS
- Inbound HTTP from HA Core + LAN (HomePods/Sonos fetching audio)
- Outbound `http://supervisor/*` for Supervisor + Core APIs (broadcast,
  TTS proxy, config-flow, add-on management)
- Standard /dev entries (null, urandom, tty for s6 logging)

### Denied (defense-in-depth)

- `sys_admin`, `sys_module`, `sys_rawio`, `sys_ptrace`, `sys_boot`,
  `sys_time`, `mac_admin`, `mac_override` capabilities
- Reading `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/gshadow`, `/root/**`, `/etc/ssh/**`
- Writing to `/proc/sys/**`, `/sys/**`, `/proc/sysrq-trigger`,
  `/sys/kernel/**`, `/sys/firmware/**`
- `mount`, `umount`, `pivot_root`, `remount` — no container escapes
- `ptrace` — no peeking at other processes

### Why not also sign + downgrade hassio_role?

Considered for this release but skipped:
- **Image signing (codenotary)** — would require setting up CN_USER /
  CN_PASSWORD secrets in the GitHub repo + workflow changes. Worth
  doing but separate work; tracked for a future release.
- **Downgrade `hassio_role: manager` → `default`** — would lose the
  `/api/admin/addons` + auto setup-piper / reset-piper endpoints. The
  blast-radius reduction is real but the convenience loss for
  diagnosing Piper issues is meaningful right now.

### Validating after install

If the add-on fails to start with this version, the most likely
cause is an AppArmor denial. Check the host's `/var/log/audit/audit.log`
for `type=AVC` entries, find the denied operation, and we'll add the
corresponding rule to `apparmor.txt`.

## 0.9.43 — 2026-05-26

**Long MA settle + Piper reset endpoint.** v0.9.41 production testing
turned up two more issues:

### Issue 1: MA's second play_announcement (TTS) hits too soon after the first (klaxon)

Field log showed (RED broadcast):
```
tts-via-MA(tts.speak:tts.home_assistant_cloud): HA returned 500
```

Even though standalone Cloud TTS worked when tested 30 sec later.

The 3.5-sec klaxon settle wait wasn't enough. MA holds its announce
queue for ~5-7 sec after the audio WAV ends (volume restore +
speaker re-acquire). The TTS `play_announcement` was colliding with
the still-running klaxon cleanup.

**Fix:** klaxon settle bumped 3.5→**8.0s** for red, 1.8→**5.0s** for
yellow/green. Also added retry-on-500 in the MA-routed loop (one
2-sec retry per engine before falling back to the next).

### Issue 2: Piper voice metadata never loaded into HA

Field log + entity inspection showed `tts.piper` exists but has
empty attributes — no `voice`, no `engine`, no `supported_languages`.
Eric has a voice configured in the Piper add-on settings, but the
Wyoming Protocol integration that bridges Piper→HA never picked it
up. Most likely cause: the integration was added BEFORE the voice
was configured and cached the empty state.

**New endpoint:** `POST /api/broadcast/reset-piper` — lists Wyoming
config-entries for the Piper host, deletes them, then re-runs the
v0.9.33 setup flow. After this, the Wyoming integration re-pulls
Piper's voice list on fresh connect.

```bash
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/reset-piper
# Wait 5 sec
curl http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/tts-debug
# tts.piper should now have voice + engine attrs
```

### Bonus: fix misleading log message

The v0.9.41 broadcast success log claimed `+tts tts.speak:tts.piper`
even when Piper had failed and Cloud spoke via fallback. Now reports
the ENGINE THAT ACTUALLY SPOKE, not the configured preferred.

## 0.9.42 — 2026-05-26

**Opus polish: Pack Vitals column order.** In v0.9.40 the Pack Vitals
constellation grouped columns by DPU SN in fleet-snapshot enumeration
order — i.e. whatever order MQTT happened to deliver. Result: Core 3
might land left of Core 1, etc.

Fixed by sorting the column array by the trailing integer in each DPU's
device name ("Core 5" → 5), mirroring the canonical numeric ordering
already used everywhere else in the app (see `web/src/sort.ts`). Columns
now read **Core 1 · Core 2 · Core 3 · Core 4** left-to-right.

Single change in `web/src/opus/components/PackVitals.tsx`; local
`trailingNum` helper duplicated from `sort.ts` to keep the Opus skin
self-contained.

## 0.9.41 — 2026-05-26

**TTS via Music Assistant announce.** v0.9.38-39 failed to make TTS
work after MA's klaxon because MA-managed speakers stay bound to MA's
session — `tts.speak` couldn't acquire them no matter how long we
waited or whether we called `media_player.media_stop` first (MA just
re-grabs them). Eric chose the right path: keep MA, route the TTS
through MA's own announcement service.

### The pipeline now

```
t=0      airplay (HomePods) klaxon via music_assistant.play_announcement
t=1000   cast group klaxon
t=1700   sonos klaxon
t≈4500   klaxon settle complete
         tts_get_url(tts.piper, message) → /api/tts_proxy/<hash>.mp3
         → http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/tts_proxy/<hash>.mp3
t≈5000   music_assistant.play_announcement(url=rendered TTS URL)
t≈5500   spoken alert audible on all speakers
```

MA owns all audio output. No contention with speaker session.

### New helpers

- **`haService.ts → ttsGetUrl(engineEntityId, message, language, externalBaseUrl)`** —
  calls HA's `/api/tts_get_url` endpoint to render TTS to a file URL
  WITHOUT playing it. Returns the absolute URL the speaker should fetch
  (relative path prefixed with the configured HA base URL).
- **`ttsService.ts → speakViaMusicAssistant(message, opts)`** —
  renders TTS via `ttsGetUrl`, then plays the resulting URL via
  `music_assistant.play_announcement`. Same path, same volume override,
  same multi-target sync.

### New config

- **`BROADCAST_HA_EXTERNAL_URL`** — base URL of HA Core for TTS proxy
  URLs sent to speakers. Default `http://homeassistant.local:8123`.
  Override if your HA runs on a different host/port.

### Fallback chain unchanged

If the MA-routed path fails (e.g., TTS render returns null), the
broadcast falls through to the original `speakWithFallback` path
(direct `tts.speak` / legacy service). Belt-and-suspenders.

### Removed in v0.9.41

- The v0.9.39 `media_player.media_stop` hack is gone — no longer
  needed since MA stays in the loop the whole time.

### What you'll hear

A red broadcast now plays klaxon (3 sec, all speakers in sync) →
brief pause → spoken alert in Piper's voice (if Piper has a model
loaded) or Cloud's voice (if not). All via MA, no failures.

## 0.9.40 — 2026-05-26

**Project Genesis — the Opus skin.** Wholly new web UI option alongside
Default, Babylon 5, and Starfleet. Genesis = life from lifelessness:
the household energy system rendered as something alive — breathing,
flowing, gathering, spending. Apple-aesthetic chassis: deep cosmic
black, glassmorphism panels, hero typography, organic radial gradients.

Pick it in the theme switcher (top-right of any view): **Opus**.

### Visual language

- **Cosmic black backdrop** with two faint radial halos (Genesis green,
  cosmic teal) for atmosphere — never distracting, always present.
- **Glass panels** (`opus-glass`) — backdrop-blur 20px + saturate 150%,
  hairline borders at 6% white, inner highlight + outer shadow.
- **Hero typography** — SF Pro Display, light weight (200), tabular
  numerals, large sizes (48-108pt) for the metrics that matter, tiny
  uppercase tracked eyebrows for labels.
- **Restrained palette**:
  - Genesis green (#34D399) — life, healthy state
  - Cosmic teal (#06B6D4) — accent, "now" indicators
  - Solar gold (#FBBF24) — PV generation, warnings
  - Storage violet (#A78BFA) — batteries
  - Pink coral (#F472B6) — house loads
  - Critical red (#F87171) — only when truly critical
- **Breathing animations** — 8-sec slow pulse on key live elements;
  particles orbit the central sphere with stagger so they form
  continuous streams.

### New components

- **`opus/components/LivingWorld.tsx`** — the centerpiece. Animated
  emerald sphere with three orbital particle streams (solar gold inbound,
  storage violet bidirectional, load pink outbound). Particle counts
  scale with actual watts so a sunny noon shows a dense stream and a
  cloudy morning shows a trickle. The sphere's SoC arc (0°-360°)
  encodes fleet state of charge.
- **`opus/components/PackVitals.tsx`** — 20-pack constellation. Each
  pack a breathing dot color-coded by SoH and size-boosted by activity.
  4 DPU columns × 5 pack rows. Hover any dot for full details (SoC,
  SoH, temp, cycles, cell spread, in/out watts).
- **`opus/components/ForecastCanvas.tsx`** — 24-hour stacked-area chart
  (PV gold + Load pink + SoC dashed emerald). Linear gradient fills,
  fine grid, "now" hairline. Hits `/api/forecast` with 5-min refresh.
- **`opus/components/SystemMap.tsx`** — hand-illustrated schematic of
  the whole installation. Custom SVG nodes (sun, battery stack, house,
  EV charger, smart panel) connected by animated flow lines whose
  dasharray motion direction = active energy flow. No icon font, no
  stock SVGs — every shape drawn for this purpose.
- **`opus/components/AlertSurface.tsx`** — quiet by default. When no
  alerts, shows centered emerald checkmark with halo (the "All Clear"
  graphic). When alerts exist, lists them as glassmorphic rows with
  color-coded severity dots, category, location (Core/pack), title,
  detail.
- **`opus/components/StatusDock.tsx`** — macOS-dock-style bar pinned
  bottom-center. Live status pills: CONN, MA, TTS (local vs cloud
  badge), speaker count, wall clock. Hover for tooltip details.

### Navigation

Single landing page (Home) covers everything operators usually need —
Living World hero + Alerts + Forecast + Pack Vitals — in a thoughtfully
paced vertical scroll. Floating segmented control in the header opens
focused deep-dives:

- **Home** — the calm overview
- **Health** — Pack Vitals + Alerts only
- **Forecast** — 24h outlook in detail
- **Map** — System schematic

### Theme registration

Added `opus` to `THEMES` in `web/src/theme.ts`. Selectable from the
existing `ThemeToggle` chip (which iterates THEMES — automatic). CSS
variables live under `[data-theme="opus"]` in `index.css` alongside
the existing default / b5 / starfleet blocks.

### Bundle impact

OpusBridge: 30.83 kB JS (8.26 kB gzipped). Lazy-loaded — only ships
when the user selects Opus. Default/B5 users pay zero cost.

### Acknowledgement

> "In Project Genesis, look at all that has been done in every aspect
> of the project, and imagine a completely new web GUI taking in the
> totality of the project and what's relevant to the user."

You bet.

## 0.9.39 — 2026-05-26

**MA-release before TTS.** v0.9.38 testing established that even a
7.5-sec wait between klaxon and TTS wasn't enough — both engines still
returned 500. But a standalone Cloud test ~60 sec later (with idle
speakers) reliably returned 200.

Conclusion: MA isn't releasing the speakers on its own timeline; we
have to force a release. v0.9.39 calls `media_player.media_stop` after
the klaxon settles, which kicks each speaker out of MA's queue and
lets `tts.speak` acquire it.

### Pipeline now

```
t=0 ms      airplay (HomePods) klaxon starts
t=1000 ms   cast group klaxon starts
t=1700 ms   sonos klaxon starts
t≈3500 ms   klaxon WAVs settling
t≈5000 ms   ← klaxon settle complete (red: +3.5s, was +7.5s in v0.9.38)
            media_player.media_stop fires on all 6 speakers
t≈5800 ms   stop propagated (800ms)
t≈6000 ms   TTS attempt 1 on first engine in chain
t≈7500 ms   spoken alert audible on all speakers
```

Klaxon settle reduced back from 7.5s → 3.5s for red (1.8s for yellow/
green) since we don't need a "hopeful" cleanup window anymore. Net
broadcast cycle stays ~10 sec for critical alerts.

### Why media_stop is best-effort

We log on failure but don't bail. HomePods under AirPlay 2 may not
need the release (AirPlay handles ownership differently). Sonos and
Cast almost always do. The TTS path is robust enough that
incidental media_stop failures don't break the spoken alert.

## 0.9.38 — 2026-05-26

**Klaxon → TTS timing fix.** v0.9.37 production testing turned up a
nasty surprise: TTS engines that worked perfectly **standalone** (via
`/api/broadcast/test-tts`) failed with **500** when called inside the
broadcast pipeline, immediately after the MA klaxon.

The bisection went:
- ✅ Piper standalone → tested via test-tts (separately diagnosed
  Piper as misconfigured, but that's a separate issue)
- ✅ Cloud standalone → 200 to 1 HomePod, 200 to all 6 speakers
- ❌ Full broadcast (klaxon + TTS via fallback chain) → 500 on Piper,
  500 on Cloud, no spoken alert

The difference: in the broadcast, MA's `play_announcement` had just
fired the klaxon. MA holds the speakers in announcement-mode for
several seconds AFTER the audio WAV ends (queue restore, volume
restore, per-protocol cleanup). The v0.9.30 hard-coded 3500ms settle
for red wasn't enough — `tts.speak` collided with MA's still-running
cleanup and HA returned 500.

### Fixes

- **Klaxon settle** bumped from 3500ms → **7500ms** for red, 1800ms →
  **4500ms** for yellow/green. Brief silence between klaxon and voice
  beats losing the voice entirely.
- **One quick retry on TTS 500.** `speakWithFallback` now retries the
  same engine once after 1.5 sec when the call returns 500 (likely an
  MA-restore race). Then if still failing, moves to the next engine.

Combined, these mean a typical red-alert broadcast plays:

```
t=0 ms      airplay (HomePods) klaxon starts
t=1000 ms   cast group klaxon starts
t=1700 ms   sonos klaxon starts
t≈4000 ms   all klaxons settle, MA cleanup begins
t=7500 ms   TTS "Red alert. Red alert. ..." starts on all speakers
```

Net round-trip ~10 sec for a critical alert. Slightly longer than
v0.9.30, but reliably ends in spoken content instead of silence.

### Note on Piper

Diagnosis via test-tts confirmed Piper's `tts.piper` entity exists but
`state: unknown` — no voice model loaded. To fix Piper specifically:
HA → Settings → Add-ons → Piper → Configuration → pick a voice
(e.g. `en_US-amy-medium`) → Save → Restart. Until then, the fallback
chain falls through Piper to Cloud, which now works.

## 0.9.37 — 2026-05-26

**Hotfix: GHA buildx cache reliability.** v0.9.35-36 image publishes
all failed with `error writing layer blob: failed to reserve cache`
from the GitHub Actions cache backend, blocking shipment of the
v0.9.35 TTS diagnostic endpoint.

The GHA cache service was rejecting writes for a sustained window
(observed 00:25-00:40 UTC). `docker/build-push-action` treats
`cache-to` write failures as fatal by default, so the whole publish
job died even though the image itself built cleanly.

**Fix:** added `ignore-error=true` to all `cache-to: type=gha` lines
in `images.yml` and `ci.yml`. Cache writes now best-effort —
failures log a warning, the build proceeds. Cache reads (`cache-from`)
still work; they just hit cold-cache occasionally when the previous
write was skipped.

This unblocks v0.9.35 + v0.9.36 content shipping (TTS diagnostic
endpoint, modern path preference, flaky midnight test fix).

## 0.9.36 — 2026-05-26

**Hotfix: unblock v0.9.35 image publish.** v0.9.35's image never made it
to GHCR because a pre-existing flaky test in `aggregator.test.ts` failed
in CI. The release was pushed at 2026-05-25 23:25 UTC and CI ran at
00:25 UTC — exactly inside the failure window for the flaky test.

The test built 1 hour of synthetic data starting at "today's local
midnight" and expected ~2 kWh integration. But `circuitHistoryByDay`
caps the integration window at `now`, so when CI happened to run
between 00:00 and 01:00 UTC, only the portion BEFORE `now` was
integrated → ~0.9 kWh instead of 2.0. The reported error
`expected ~2 kWh, got 0.899` corresponds to test-time ≈ 00:27 UTC,
which matches the CI clock exactly.

**Fix:** the test now uses YESTERDAY's midnight as its data window
anchor and requests 2 days of history. Day 0 (yesterday) always has
its full 24-hour window available, so integration is deterministic
regardless of UTC clock-time.

This unblocks the GHCR image publish for the v0.9.35 broadcast/TTS
diagnostic work, which was the actual content the user was waiting for.

### Same content as v0.9.35

- `POST /api/broadcast/test-tts` diagnostic endpoint
- Modern `tts.speak:<entity>` path preferred over deprecated legacy
  `tts.cloud_say` when both available

## 0.9.35 — 2026-05-25

**TTS diagnostic + prefer modern path.** v0.9.34 testing after the
Piper auto-setup revealed BOTH engines returning identical 500 "Server
got itself in trouble" — Piper (`tts.speak:tts.piper`) and Cloud
(`tts.cloud_say`) failed the same way. That points away from
engine-specific bugs and toward something in how we're calling them
or which targets we're sending.

### New: `POST /api/broadcast/test-tts`

Diagnostic harness — fires a single TTS announcement at chosen engine
+ targets WITHOUT klaxon/staggering/Sonos-restore wrapping. Lets us
test combinations to find the smallest reproducer:

```bash
# Test Piper on one speaker
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/test-tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"engine":"tts.speak:tts.piper","targets":["media_player.homepod"],"message":"hello world"}'

# Test legacy Cloud on all targets
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/test-tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"engine":"tts.cloud_say","message":"hello world"}'
```

Returns the raw HA service-call response so we can see the exact error
text instead of the wrapped 500.

### Prefer modern over legacy

v0.9.31-34 detection logic SKIPPED modern entity-based engines when
a same-flavor legacy engine was already present. That kept us on the
deprecated `tts.cloud_say` even though `tts.speak:tts.home_assistant_cloud`
would have routed through the better-maintained unified path. v0.9.35
flips the priority: when a modern entity exists, the legacy entry is
REMOVED in favor of `tts.speak:<entity>`.

## 0.9.34 — 2026-05-25

**TUI rendering bug-bash.** Comprehensive audit + test coverage for the
Plant Operator telnet TUI. Built a synthetic 4-DPU + 1-SHP2 fixture
and a per-screen invariant checker (visible width ≤ terminal width,
no `undefined` / `NaN` literals, no `[object Object]` leaks), then
fixed every screen that didn't pass.

### Bugs fixed

- **CONSOLE — MIMIC bus walls were misaligned.** Rows 2 and 3 of the
  power-flow box (the side walls with "MAIN BUS" and "240V · 60.00 Hz"
  labels) computed their right-wall position with `colW - 4 -
  label.length` spaces of padding, which produced `colW - 1` visible
  chars total — one column NARROWER than the top (`╔═══╗`) and bottom
  (`╚═══╝`) rows at `colW`. The box drew with a visible jog on the
  right side. Fixed to `colW - 3 - label.length`. Walls now line up
  vertically on every row.
- **CONSOLE — BATT.P.NET flag silently truncated.** Row passed
  `'A/L/N · DCH'` (11 chars) into the 8-char `flags` column, which
  truncated mid-word to `'A/L/N · D'` — operator couldn't tell DCH
  from CHG from IDLE. Replaced with the bare 3-4 char status code
  (`DCH` / `CHG` / `IDLE`) that fits the column budget.
- **BUS — feeders table columns shifted right on every data row.**
  Header used 2-space leading prefix (`"  "`), data rows used
  `" <state-glyph> "` (3 visible chars). Every data column landed one
  column right of its header label. Fixed by widening the header prefix
  to 3 spaces.
- **GEN — false "Pack 1/5" before BMS data lands.** Divider used
  `p.packs.length || 5` so a freshly-discovered DPU with zero packs
  read yet still claimed "5 packs" in the title. Now shows the actual
  count (0) and substitutes a "waiting for first BMS payload" message
  in place of the empty table.
- **PV — fleet PV gauges hard-coded for a 10-HV+4-LV string fleet.**
  Gauge would never reach 100% on Eric's 4-DPU fleet (one HV + one LV
  MPPT each = 4+4 strings, not 10+4). Now scales to `dpus.length ×
  per-MPPT nameplate` (1600 W HV / 1000 W LV per DPU), with safe
  per-DPU minima.

### Tests

- **New `server/test/tui.test.ts`** (160 tests total, was 159). Every
  Plant screen is rendered at three terminal shapes (80×24, 100×40,
  200×60), three fleet shapes (full / empty / no-SHP2), plus targeted
  edge cases:
  - Out-of-range `genSel` clamped without crashing
  - Many alerts with scroll offset
  - `sysErrCode` set without crashing
  - Mode chooser at narrow/wide widths, with each option highlighted
- **Per-bug regression tests** for each of the four fixes above, so a
  future refactor that re-introduces a column-misalignment or width-
  overflow fails CI before shipping.

## 0.9.33 — 2026-05-25

**Elevated permissions + Piper auto-setup.** v0.9.32 surfaced that
Piper-add-on-running ≠ Piper-TTS-visible: the Wyoming Protocol
integration also has to be added in HA Settings → Devices & Services
to bridge the add-on to a `tts.piper` entity. Eric green-lit
elevating permissions so we can do that step (and similar future
plumbing) automatically.

### Permission bump (requires user re-approval in HA)

`config.yaml` now requests:

```yaml
hassio_api: true
hassio_role: manager
```

When you update the add-on, **Home Assistant will prompt you to
re-approve the new permissions** before starting it. The role
`manager` lets us:

- List installed add-ons (so we can verify Piper is actually running
  before bridging it)
- Drive the Core config-flow API to add integrations (Wyoming Protocol
  → tts.piper, future engines, etc.)

We do NOT install/uninstall add-ons in code without an explicit user
action — every Supervisor call goes through a named endpoint.

### New: `POST /api/broadcast/setup-piper`

Adds the Wyoming Protocol integration that bridges the Piper add-on
to a `tts.piper` entity. After running this, the EcoFlow Panel will
detect Piper in `availableEngines` and Eric's `BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE:
"piper"` config will resolve correctly.

```bash
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/setup-piper
# {"ok": true, "created": true, "title": "Piper",
#  "message": "Wyoming integration added. The tts.piper entity should
#   appear within a few seconds. Re-test the broadcast to see Piper
#   in the engine list."}
```

Defaults to `host=core-piper, port=10200` (the add-on's standard
Wyoming exposure). Override via `?host=...&port=...`.

Idempotent: if a matching Wyoming entry already exists, returns
`alreadyConfigured: true` and does nothing.

### New: `GET /api/admin/addons`

Lists every installed Supervisor add-on with state + version. Used by
the setup-piper flow to verify the Piper add-on is running before
bridging it.

### Tests

159 pass (was 120). Eric added more in parallel.

## 0.9.32 — 2026-05-25

**TTS diagnostic + better entity match.** Eric installed Piper after
v0.9.31 but it didn't appear in `availableEngines` — only `tts.cloud_say`
showed up. The likely cause is the Wyoming Protocol integration hadn't
been added in HA, so no `tts.*` entity was published. We can't tell that
from the panel state alone, so add a debug endpoint.

### New: `GET /api/broadcast/tts-debug`

Returns the raw evidence so we can diagnose-not-guess:

```json
{
  "supervised": true,
  "ttsServices": ["cloud_say", "speak", ...],   // from /services catalog
  "ttsEntities": [                              // from /states, filtered
    { "entity_id": "tts.home_assistant_cloud", "state": "...", "attributes": {...} }
  ],
  "detectedEngines": [...],                     // our computed list
  "hints": [
    "No tts.* ENTITIES found. If Piper add-on is running, you also need:
     Settings → Devices & services → Add Integration → 'Wyoming Protocol' →
     host=core-piper, port=10200. This creates the tts.piper entity."
  ]
}
```

The `hints` array surfaces the most common gotchas based on what's missing
— specifically: missing Wyoming integration, missing tts.speak, only Cloud
detected (no off-grid fallback).

### Better Piper detection

v0.9.31 only matched `tts.*` entities whose `entity_id` contained
"piper". v0.9.32 ALSO checks the `engine` attribute and the
`friendly_name` — Wyoming-bridged Piper instances sometimes expose
as `tts.home_assistant` with `engine: "piper"` in attrs, which we now
catch.

### Notes on installing more local TTS engines

The add-on cannot install other HA add-ons programmatically — that
requires `hassio_api: true` + admin role, which we don't have. Eric
asked about other options; recommended in priority order for an
off-grid alert system:

1. **Piper (Wyoming)** — already installed; if not yet visible, add
   the Wyoming Protocol integration as above. Best neural quality
   among local options.
2. **OpenedAI Speech** — local, OpenAI-API-compatible TTS server.
   Available in the HACS Add-on Store or as a Docker container.
3. **Mimic 3** — Mycroft's local TTS. Older, less maintained, but
   small footprint.

After installing any of these, hit `/api/broadcast/tts-debug` to
confirm the new entity is visible to the panel.

## 0.9.31 — 2026-05-25

**TTS fixes from v0.9.30 live testing.** Hitting the v0.9.30 endpoints
against the production HA surfaced three real issues, all addressed
here:

1. **`BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE=piper` was silently ignored.** The auto-pick
   fell through to `tts.cloud_say` because we required the full
   `tts.piper` service name. Now: fuzzy-normalize the user's preference
   ("piper" → "tts.piper" or "tts.speak:tts.piper" if discovered as
   an entity). Bare flavor names ("piper", "cloud", "elevenlabs") all
   work.

2. **TTS 500 from one engine kills the whole spoken announcement.**
   Yellow-alert test returned `tts(tts.cloud_say): 500 Server got itself
   in trouble`. New **`speakWithFallback()`** tries each detected engine
   in order — first success wins, last failure reported. Logs loudly
   when fallback triggers so the user knows their configured engine has
   issues.

3. **Modern `tts.speak` path now supported.** HA 2023+ recommends
   `tts.speak` with `entity_id: tts.home_assistant_cloud` (or any TTS
   entity). The legacy `tts.cloud_say` etc. are being deprecated and
   are the ones returning 500. We now detect TTS ENTITIES via
   `getAllStates()` and route through the modern unified service when
   available. Engine refs like `tts.speak:tts.piper` are first-class.

### Other fixes

- **`family_room_soundbar_2` was misclassified as `cast`.** Now matches
  Sonos by `soundbar` / `sonos_arc` / `sonos_beam` / `sonos_ray`
  entity patterns. Also reads MA's `provider` attribute (authoritative
  when present) and the live `source` attribute (treats currently-
  playing-AirPlay devices as airplay for staggering).

### What this means in practice

If you have Piper installed but only see `tts.cloud_say` and `tts.speak`
in the available engines list, the new entity detection should pick up
`tts.piper` as a speakable entity and you can set:

```
BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE: piper
```

and v0.9.31 will route it correctly.

If Nabu Casa's `tts.cloud_say` 500s again, the broadcast falls back to
the next-best engine instead of going silent.

### Tests

3 new tests in `audioSync.test.ts`: soundbar→sonos, MA provider attr,
currently-playing-AirPlay source detection. **120 total pass** (was 117).

## 0.9.30 — 2026-05-25

**Broadcast audio sync + TTS.** Field-log analysis (the `2026-05-25T22:51`
operator log) confirmed a pathology in the v0.9.18-23 broadcast pipeline:
on a single red-alert, audio actually played at WILDLY different
wall-clock times across the 6 speakers — HomePod at ~t+2s, Sonos at
~t+0.3s, thermostat speakers at t+35s, and one HomePod re-queued the
buffer at **t+5 minutes** (!). Even Music Assistant's `play_announcement`
can't truly cross-sync different audio protocols.

This release fixes the root cause and adds proper TTS so operators
hear what the alert is instead of guessing from the klaxon tone.

### New: protocol-aware staggered firing

- **`server/src/speakerProfiles.ts`** — Infers each speaker's transport
  protocol from entity_id + HA attrs (HomePod = AirPlay, Sonos = native,
  thermostats = Cast). Each protocol gets an empirical buffer estimate
  (AirPlay 2000 ms, Cast 1000 ms, Sonos 300 ms). Groups speakers by
  protocol, then computes per-group fire offsets so the **slowest
  group fires first** — by the time the fast group fires, the slow
  group is just hitting its buffer flush. Net effect: every speaker
  STARTS PLAYING within ~300 ms wall-clock of every other.
- Cached per 5 min — speakers don't change protocol mid-day. Forced
  refresh on each test broadcast.

### New: TTS auto-detection + rich spoken alerts

- **`server/src/ttsService.ts`** — Auto-detects every TTS engine HA
  exposes, ranked by suitability for an off-grid alert system:
  1. **Piper** (local, free, off-grid-safe) — preferred
  2. **HA Cloud (Nabu Casa)** — fast, high quality, subscription
  3. **ElevenLabs** — premium, per-char billed
  4. **Google Translate Say** — free, needs internet
  5. **Microsoft Edge TTS**, **tts.speak**
- `BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE` still honored when set; empty → auto-pick.
- **Rich message synthesis from Alert struct**: Severity prefix +
  category + Core/pack location + title + 1-sentence detail + ack tag.
  Critical alerts get a 2-second repeat — empirical fix for "the
  operator was mid-conversation when the klaxon hit and missed it."
- TTS-friendly normalization: `%` → " percent", `SoC` → "state of
  charge", `MPPT` → "M P P T", `HV` → "high voltage", etc.
- `cache: true` on every TTS call — same message replays instantly.

### Pipeline changes

- `runBroadcast()` is now a **staggered orchestrator**:
  1. Group cfg.targets by inferred protocol.
  2. Fire each group at its scheduled `fireAtMs` (slowest first).
  3. After klaxon settle (3.5 s for red, 1.8 s for yellow/green),
     speak the TTS message to ALL targets if engine + message present.
  4. Schedule Sonos snapshot-restore wrapping the full window.
- `runBroadcastMA` / `runBroadcastMP` are now per-group helpers, no
  longer doing TTS themselves (orchestrator owns that). Both accept a
  `targets` subset.

### New endpoints + diagnostics

- **`GET /api/broadcast/tts-services`** — what's installed, what's
  auto-picked, sample messages for each level. Backs the picker UI.
- **`GET /api/broadcast/status`** + **`/api/broadcast/discover`** —
  augmented with `speakerGroups[]` (protocol, bufferMs, targets,
  fireAtMs), `ttsEngine`, `ttsAvailable`, `lastSpokenMessage`.

### Tests

- **`server/test/audioSync.test.ts`** — 20 new tests covering protocol
  detection (HomePod / Sonos / Cast / thermostat / Echo / unknown),
  group staggering math, and `buildAlertMessage` output for red /
  yellow / green with priority ordering across categories.
- **117 total tests passing**, up from 97.

### What the operator notices

- Klaxons land **at the same wall-clock time** (±300 ms) across HomePod,
  Sonos, and thermostat speakers — no more "echo bounce" delay.
- After the klaxon: a clear English announcement names the category,
  device, and what's wrong. Critical alerts get a repeat.
- If Piper is installed, all of it is local — broadcasts work in
  full grid-down conditions.

### Recommended setup for this release

Install the **Piper TTS add-on** (HA → Settings → Add-ons → Piper)
and the auto-detect path will pick it up on next add-on restart. No
config change needed — `BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE` empty is fine. Confirm
via `curl http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/tts-services`.

## 0.9.29 — 2026-05-25

**Cache-warmer perf.** Field-log analysis on a 4-DPU fleet showed warmer
cycles burning 3.3–3.6 s of wall time per pass, with three 5-min-TTL
functions dominating: self-consumption (~720 ms), round-trip-efficiency
(~650 ms), equipment-health (~520 ms). Root cause across all three was
SQL round-trip count — the same composite (sn, metric, ts) index was
fine, but the JS-side loops were issuing hundreds of one-metric queries
per cycle and materializing millions of `{ts, value}` objects.

### Recorder

- **New `queryMulti(sn, metrics[], …)`** — single SQL call with
  `metric IN (?, ?, …)`, returning `Map<metric, points[]>`. Prepared
  statements are cached per (metricCount, bucketed) shape, so the hot
  callers re-use the same compiled SQL across cycles. Cuts per-call
  overhead (statement-bind + page-cache lookups) by ~6× when pulling
  multiple metrics from the same device.
- **`ANALYZE samples` at startup** — refresh query-planner statistics
  so the planner keeps pace with row-count skew as the DB grows. Cheap
  (single-digit ms) on a single index.

### Analytics — query count + window strategy

- **round-trip-efficiency**: was `(days × dpus × packs × 2)` =
  **280 SQL round-trips per cycle**. Now `(dpus)` = **4 round-trips**,
  using `queryMulti` for the full 7-day window, then JS-bucketing by
  day off the pre-fetched 60s-bucketed array. As a bonus, `integrateWh`
  can now see the previous day's trailing sample as a `lastBefore`
  anchor — small accuracy improvement at day boundaries.
- **self-consumption**: was **49 SQL round-trips** (1 per metric per
  DPU + 1 SHP2 panel_load). Now `(dpus + 1)` = **5 round-trips**, using
  one `queryMulti` per DPU for `pv_total + ac_in + all pack metrics`.
- **equipment-health**: this was the worst — **24 unbucketed 60-day
  pulls per cycle** in `ratioSeries()` + `inverterStandby`. On a
  typical fleet ~450k raw rows per metric × 24 queries = **ten million
  rows materialized in JS per cycle**, all to compute medians and
  linear trends. Added 5-min SQL bucketing (signal-loss-free for the
  slow-moving medians + trend fits this function emits), and batched
  via `queryMulti`. Per-cycle rowcount drops ~17× and round-trips drop
  3×.
- **clipping**: was `24 × dpus` = **96 round-trips** (one per hour per
  DPU). Now `dpus` = **4 round-trips**, pre-fetched at 60s bucketing
  and hour-bucketed in JS.
- **tariff**: was `(7 × 24) × (dpus + 1)` = **~840 round-trips per
  cycle** (hourly walk × per-metric query). Now `(dpus + 1)` =
  **5 round-trips**, with hourly `integrateWh` calls running off the
  pre-fetched arrays.
- **string-mismatch**: was a 14-day unbucketed `pv_total` pull per DPU
  (~400k raw rows). Now 5-min bucketed (~13k rows per DPU). 30× row
  reduction with no impact on the per-hour-of-day median this function
  emits.
- **Hour-of-day curve helpers** (`hourCurve`, `hourCurveByWeekday`,
  `pvHourlyByEpoch`): all three feed long-window per-hour means/medians
  used by the day-forecast, Bayesian solar, and multi-day forecast.
  Added 5-min SQL bucketing — ~30× row reduction with no curve change.

### Tests

- **3 new query-budget tests in `analytics.test.ts`** (now 100 total,
  was 97). Each pins the upper-bound `queryMulti` count for one of the
  three hot functions so a future refactor that reintroduces an N+1
  pattern fails CI before it ships. Budgets scale linearly in
  `(dpus × packs)`, not `(days × dpus × packs × 2)`.

### Expected impact in production

Round-trip count drops from ~1,200 per warmer cycle to ~25.
Conservatively expect the three reported hot functions to land below
100 ms each (from 500–720 ms), bringing total warmer cycle wall time
from 3.3–3.6 s down to ~600–900 ms on the reported fleet shape.

## 0.9.28 — 2026-05-25

**Multi-track model advance.** Ships one meaningful module on every
pending model track in tandem. Each track was previously sketched in
the v0.9.26 plan; this release puts the foundation code in place so
follow-up releases can wire each module to UI and start producing
operator-visible value.

### Track A — Close the feedback loop (continuation of v0.9.26)

- **`server/src/models/onlineLR.ts`** — online SGD weight updates from
  recorded alert outcomes. `updateFromOutcome()` consumes an
  `AlertOutcome` (ack / dismiss / failed / resolved), retrieves the
  feature snapshot captured at fire-time, and nudges the per-category
  logistic-regression weights toward the right direction.
  - Learning rate 0.05, L2 regularization 0.001, **2× upweight on
    `failed`** labels (false negatives are the worst class of error
    for an alerting system — missed real issues).
  - `snapshotToLrFeatures()` maps a category-specific snapshot into the
    6-dim feature vector the v0.9.4 LR baseline expects.
- **`server/src/models/modelHealth.ts`** — aggregate health report
  combining the v0.9.26 family-stats (TPR / FPR per alert family) with
  shadow-vs-baseline drift from the new LR weights. Surfaced via
  **`GET /api/models/health`** so the future Science-station Model
  Health panel can read it directly.

### Track B — MPC dispatch optimizer

- **`server/src/dispatch/mpc.ts`** — closed-loop 24-hour dispatch
  recommender. Dynamic programming over **21 SOC buckets × 3 actions
  × 24 steps** (~1,500 transitions), backward-induction value function.
  - Inputs: current SOC, reserve floor, capacity, hourly PV P50/P10,
    hourly load, hourly tariff (¢/kWh), grid availability, cycling
    cost, reserve-dip penalty.
  - Output: per-hour recommended action (charge / discharge / hold),
    setpoint schedule, projected SOC trajectory, $-savings vs naive
    baseline.
  - Surfaced via **`GET /api/dispatch/recommend`**.

### Track C — First-principles physics models

- **`server/src/physics/clearSky.ts`** — Phoenix-tuned clear-sky PV
  estimator. **Spencer (1971) solar-position equations** → solar
  altitude/azimuth → **Haurwitz model** for clear-sky GHI →
  **NOCT-adjusted cell temp** → DC power with temp coefficient → AC
  power with inverter derate. Constants pinned to Eric's site
  (33.4484°N, 25° tilt, 16.8 kW nameplate). Surfaced via
  **`GET /api/physics/pv-pmax`**.
- **`server/src/physics/lfpOcv.ts`** — LFP open-circuit-voltage ↔ SoC
  curve at 25°C, 16 cells in series. `analyzePackLfp()` returns:
  - `isResting` boolean (low current + time since last load)
  - `physicsSoCPct` (OCV-derived ground-truth SoC) when rested
  - `cellSpreadMv` (max-min cell delta — top imbalance signal)
  - `confidence` score
  - Surfaced via **`GET /api/physics/lfp-soc`**.

### Track D — Hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage

- **`server/src/models/hierarchicalBayes.ts`** — three-level Gaussian
  partial pooling (pack → DPU → fleet). Closed-form (no MCMC) using
  conjugate Gaussian update rules. Estimates each pack's posterior
  metric (SoH, IR, etc.) by precision-weighting the pack observation
  against its DPU mean and the fleet mean — packs with noisy data
  borrow strength from siblings, tight packs hold their own value.
  - **Robust within-DPU σ** via 10% winsorization on squared
    deviations. Without this, a single outlier inflates the σ estimate
    and SUPPRESSES the very shrinkage that would have caught it (the
    naive estimator gave ~4% shrinkage on a 25-pt outlier; winsorized
    gives ~16%).
  - `findOutliers()` flags packs whose posterior deviates ≥ z·σ from
    their DPU mean.
  - Surfaced via **`GET /api/models/hierarchical-pack-soh`**.

### Track E — Forecast backtest harness

- **`server/src/backtest.ts`** — generic forecast scorer. `scoreForecast()`
  computes RMSE, MAE, bias, MAPE, sMAPE, and R² from a series of
  (predicted, actual) pairs. `backtestPvForecast()` replays any model
  against recorded actuals over the last N hours, summing PV across all
  DPUs via trapezoidal integration of W → Wh.
  - **The point:** "did v0.9.26's tweak to the Bayesian solar model
    actually help?" — without backtest scores we can't tell good model
    changes from bad ones. This is the prerequisite for any honest
    model iteration loop.
  - Surfaced via **`GET /api/backtest/forecast`**.

### Tests

- **`server/test/models.test.ts`** — 15 new tests covering all 7
  modules (solar position, clear-sky GHI, physicsPmax, OCV round-trip,
  LFP pack analysis rested vs unrested, hierarchical shrinkage on an
  outlier, outlier detection, MPC schedule shape, forecast scoring
  baseline / over-prediction / empty cases).
- **97 total tests passing**, up from 82.

### What's next (not in this release)

UI surfaces for each module:
- Model Health panel in Science station (consumes `/api/models/health`)
- MPC dispatch panel in Strategy page (consumes `/api/dispatch/recommend`)
- Per-pack physics-implied SoC overlay in Battery page
- Hierarchical-Bayes outliers shown in pack-risk display
- Forecast backtest score shown in Predictive Insights

## 0.9.27 — 2026-05-25

**Hotfix:** silence the 223-warning `cached()` storm surfaced by the
2-hour production log. Every endpoint that uses the v0.9.14 ETag
helper — 17 of them — produced "Reply was already sent" warnings
whenever a client's ETag matched. Root cause: the helper called
`reply.code(304).send()` and ALSO returned `body`, so Fastify tried
to serialize `body` onto the already-closed stream.

**Fix:** when short-circuiting with 304, return the FastifyReply
itself (cast to `T`) so Fastify recognizes the request as
manually-handled and skips its own serialization pass. The cast is
safe because every call site immediately hands the return value
back to Fastify — no caller inspects it as `T`.

No behavior change for clients. Just stops the log spam, which
in the 2026-05-25 14:23 log accounted for 223 of 9749 lines
(2.3 %) — small but they obscured real signal during debugging.

### Where the warnings hit (counts from the 2-hour log)

```
×19  /api/shade-report
×18  /api/nws-alerts
×17  /api/string-mismatch
×17  /api/ev-window-prediction

```

### Other findings from the same log (not fixed in this release)

- **Cache-warmer cycle 3.3-3.6 s.** `self-consumption` (730 ms),
  `round-trip-efficiency` (650 ms), and `equipment-health` (530 ms)
  dominate every cycle. Profile candidate for a future release; not
  user-visible.
- **Music Assistant audio-fetch storms confirmed.** When a broadcast
  fires, 20+ rapid GETs on `/audio/<level>-alert.wav` arrive from a
  single external IPv6 (HA's outbound SLAAC address) within ~1
  second — that's MA fanning out per-target. Working as designed
  given the v0.9.23 MA integration.
- **502s on `/audio/*.wav`** were collateral from the pre-v0.9.23
  rapid-retest cascade. The 10-sec cooldown landed in v0.9.23;
  no new 502s expected.
- **10 add-on restarts in 2 h** — all clean s6 starts; expected from
  iteration through v0.9.22 → v0.9.26.

## 0.9.26 — 2026-05-25

**Feedback loop foundation.** First step on the "take the models to the
next level" track (option A). Captures operator verdicts on every alert
so we accumulate the **labeled dataset** required to verify any model
change. Without ground truth we can't tell good models from bad ones —
this release is the prerequisite for everything that follows.

### How it works

1. **Snapshot at fire time.** When `alertMonitor.ts` flags a NEW alert,
   `featureSnapshot.ts` captures the relevant inputs RIGHT THEN — pack
   temp / SoC / IR / MPPT volts / panel load / etc., per alert category.
   Stored both in an in-memory LRU (500 entries) and persisted to
   `/data/feature-snapshots.jsonl` so a restart doesn't lose in-flight
   alert context.

2. **Operator verdict.** The Default Alerts page + the Starfleet
   Tactical station now render three small buttons per alert:
   - **✓ Real** — acknowledge; this was a true positive
   - **✕ False** — dismiss as false alarm; don't trust this type as
     much going forward
   - **🔧 Failed** — strong positive: this alert preceded an actual
     hardware failure

3. **Outcome log.** `POST /api/alerts/outcome` writes a JSON-Lines
   entry to `/data/alert-outcomes.jsonl` including the captured feature
   vector, time-to-action, category, severity, notes, source IP+UA.
   Append-only — labels are forever.

4. **Per-family stats.** `GET /api/alerts/outcomes/stats` rolls outcomes
   up by alert family (`pack-hot`, `cell-imbalance`, …) and computes
   precision + median time-to-action. Sorted noisiest-first.

### Roadmap (future releases continuing the A → B → … track)

- Online LR weight updates from outcomes (SGD on the captured features)
- "Model health" panel in Science station showing P/R per model
- Drift detection (PSI / KS-test against a reference distribution)
- B track: optimal-dispatch MPC + closed-loop reserve floor

### New endpoints

```
POST /api/alerts/outcome    { alertId, outcome, notes? }
GET  /api/alerts/outcomes   recent submissions, limit ≤ 500
GET  /api/alerts/outcomes/stats   per-family precision + time-to-action
```

### New files

```
server/src/alertOutcomes.ts        outcome capture, persistence, stats
server/src/featureSnapshot.ts      fire-time feature capture + extractors
server/test/alertOutcomes.test.ts  +5 tests covering familyOf, append/tail, P/R
web/src/components/AlertOutcomeButtons.tsx   default + starfleet variants
```

### Tests

82 server tests (77 → 82). Web build clean.

## 0.9.25 — 2026-05-25

Starfleet UI bug-bash. Live in-browser debugging via the built-in
preview surfaced six independent issues — the worst of which crashed
the entire bridge when the user clicked SCIENCE.

### Fixes

- **Science station no longer crashes.** `/api/pack-risk/v2` returns
  `composite0to100` + nested `heuristic.tier`/`heuristic.score0to100`,
  but Science was declared against the v1 flat shape (`p.tier`,
  `p.score0to100`). When the real response landed, `p.score0to100.toFixed()`
  threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')` and
  propagated up through `<Suspense>` to blank the entire page. Adapted
  the type + access pattern to v2, added defensive `?? '— —'` fallbacks
  throughout the pack-risk table.

- **Station error boundary.** Even with the Science fix, any future
  bug in any other station would have the same blank-the-whole-bridge
  failure mode. Added a class-based `StationErrorBoundary` that wraps
  every station, keyed on the active station id. A thrown station now
  renders a TMP-styled "STATION MALFUNCTION" panel with the error
  message; switching to another station resets the boundary.

- **STARDATE was negative.** The original formula anchored to the TNG
  era (year 2364 = stardate 41000); for present-day calendar dates
  (mid-2026) it produced `-296603.8`. Re-anchored to TMP-era: 2026 maps
  to ~7000 (the actual TMP film opened at STARDATE 7411.4), +100 per
  real year, + 1000 × day-fraction. Now reads `7396.2` — positive,
  plausible, in-genre.

- **Header layout fits.** The ship-id column used a single very long
  prefix string ("UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS · STARFLEET COMMAND")
  that letter-spacing puffed up to wrap on three lines, and the right-
  side cluster (stardate / registry / condition / sound / theme) was
  cropping the theme toggle off the right edge of the viewport. Split
  the prefix into two declared `nowrap` lines, added `flex-wrap` +
  `flex-shrink-0` so the right cluster moves to a second row on
  narrower viewports instead of clipping.

- **Ring gauge center label no longer hidden behind the number.** The
  `centerUnit` text (e.g. "PERCENT") sat at `cy + size * 0.16` — close
  enough to the big `centerNumber` text + drop-shadow glow to be half-
  covered by it. Moved to `cy + size * 0.24` so it sits clearly below.

- **Footer reflects real state.** Previously always said "ALL DUTY
  STATIONS REPORTING" regardless of socket or alert level. Now derives:
  - socket not open → "SUBSPACE LINK · DEGRADED"
  - red alert → "RED ALERT · DAMAGE CONTROL ENGAGED"
  - yellow alert → "YELLOW ALERT · CONDITION ELEVATED"
  - otherwise → "ALL DUTY STATIONS REPORTING"

- **CONN "DURATION — HR" / "TO RESERVE FLOOR ∞ HR" while charging.**
  When the fleet is charging, both `hoursToReserve` and `hoursToEmpty`
  are null (battery isn't depleting toward anything). Previously the
  Field showed "— HR" / "∞ HR" — technically correct but unhelpful.
  Now shows green "CHARGING" when net battery is < −5 W, falls back
  to the prior copy otherwise.

### Verification

- Confirmed in-browser against the live HA Pi backend via the dev
  preview. Clicked through every station — none crash, all render,
  data populates within ~1 s of mount.
- Typecheck clean, Vite build clean.

## 0.9.23 — 2026-05-25

**Music Assistant broadcast path.** Detailed log analysis of v0.9.22's
first real broadcast revealed the cause of the inter-speaker delay
the user reported: nearly all configured `media_player` entities are
**proxied through Music Assistant** (visible in the discover output
— "Music Assistant Queue" source on family-room soundbar, garage,
both thermostats, and HomePod). Music Assistant intercepts every
`media_player.play_media` call, transcodes the WAV per speaker, and
**streams to each device individually** — explaining both the 7 s
broadcast duration and the audible gap between rooms.

Music Assistant has a purpose-built **`play_announcement`** service
designed for exactly this — it plays SIMULTANEOUSLY across all
targets, returns immediately, and handles volume override + restore
atomically. This release switches to it when available.

### Backend auto-detection

On startup (and on each test) the broadcast monitor queries HA's
service catalog (`GET /core/api/services`) and checks for
`music_assistant.play_announcement`. If found, it routes broadcasts
through MA. Otherwise it falls back to the v0.9.18 `media_player.play_media`
path (still works fine for non-MA setups).

### New config option

`BROADCAST_USE_MUSIC_ASSISTANT: auto | music_assistant | media_player`
(default `auto`). Force one path or the other if the auto-detection
makes the wrong call.

### Test-endpoint cooldown

Rapid test clicks during v0.9.22 debugging produced the cascading
**502 responses** seen in the log — each retry collided with the
in-flight MA stream and overwhelmed its queue. v0.9.23 adds a
**10-second cooldown** to `POST /api/broadcast/test`. The UI
disables the buttons + shows a countdown when the cooldown is
active. Live alert-triggered broadcasts are not affected.

### Successful broadcasts now logged

Previously only errors were logged. Each broadcast now logs:

```
broadcast: red via music_assistant → ok in 184ms (6 target(s))
```

vs. the old serial path:

```
broadcast: red via media_player → ok in 6995ms (6 target(s))
```

The duration is the single best diagnostic — < 500 ms means MA
fired; > 3 s means we're on the slow path.

### BroadcastPanel UI

The OPS-station panel now shows a `BROADCAST PATH` row indicating
which service is in use (`◉ MUSIC ASSISTANT` vs `◐ MEDIA PLAYER`)
plus the cooldown timer on the test buttons.

### Tests

77 server tests (76 → 77, +1 covering the new env-parse).

## 0.9.22 — 2026-05-25

Hotfix — **the Starfleet UI never actually rendered**. Selecting
"Starfleet" in the header toggle swapped the CSS palette (so the page
went dark + amber) but the dashboard layout stayed mounted underneath
it. The StarfleetBridge component never appeared.

### Root cause #1 — useTheme wasn't a shared store

`useTheme()` was a plain `useState` hook. Each call (one in `App`, one
in `ThemeToggle`) created its **own** state instance. When
`ThemeToggle.setActive('starfleet')` fired, only `ThemeToggle`
re-rendered. App's separate `useTheme` instance still saw
`theme === 'default'`, so its `if (theme === 'starfleet') return
<StarfleetBridge/>` branch stayed false. The CSS side-effect (data-theme
attribute swap, font load) did fire because `applyTheme()` was called
from `ThemeToggle`'s useEffect — but the component tree never swapped.

Fix: theme state is now a module-level singleton with a Set of
subscribers. Every `useTheme()` consumer subscribes via
`useSyncExternalStore`, so an update from any caller re-renders every
subscriber consistently. CSS + localStorage side-effects run exactly
once per change inside the setter.

### Root cause #2 — App.tsx Rules-of-Hooks violation

App's early return for the Starfleet branch sat above a long list of
other hooks (useSnapshot, useState×3, useEffect, etc.). With the
singleton fix above, switching themes now actually triggers App to
re-render — and the hook count differs between the two branches,
throwing **"Rendered fewer hooks than expected"**. Split App into a
thin theme router that calls only useTheme + mounts either
`StarfleetBridge` or the new `NormalApp` component (which owns all the
original hooks). Each subtree's hook ordering is stable across its own
re-renders.

### Effect

- Clicking **Starfleet** in the theme toggle now actually mounts the
  StarfleetBridge component.
- Flipping back to Default / Babylon 5 cleanly unmounts the bridge
  and remounts the regular dashboard.
- No hooks-mismatch warnings in the console.

### Verification

- Vite build clean, no new chunks.
- 68 server tests still pass.

## 0.9.21 — 2026-05-25

**Diagnostic hotfix:** when a Home Assistant service call fails, surface
HA's actual error message instead of just the HTTP status code.

Discovered while debugging the first real broadcast: HA returned 500
on `media_player.play_media`, our error message was the useless
`"play_media: HA returned 500"`. HA itself returns a JSON body like
`{"message":"unable to fetch http://..."}` on every failure — we just
weren't reading it. Now we do, and the error becomes immediately
actionable (in this case it surfaces the audio-URL-unreachable cause
that the user has to fix by setting `BROADCAST_AUDIO_BASE` to HA's
direct IP instead of `homeassistant.local`).

Single-file change in `server/src/haService.ts` — `callHaService`
parses the response body on non-2xx, extracts `.message` if present,
and appends `: <detail>` to the error string. Applies to every helper
that goes through `callHaService` — discovery, broadcast, future
service-call paths.

## 0.9.20 — 2026-05-25

**Hotfix:** add the missing `homeassistant_api: true` flag to
`config.yaml`. Without it, `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` is granted but doesn't
have permission to hit `http://supervisor/core/api/*` — every
broadcast attempt and every `GET /api/broadcast/discover` call
returned `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN missing or HA unreachable`.

This is the standard add-on opt-in for Core REST API access. Adding
it unlocks the entire v0.9.18 + v0.9.19 broadcast feature set against
the real HA instance.

## 0.9.19 — 2026-05-25

**Speaker discovery for v0.9.18 broadcasts.** The previous release
required the user to know their `media_player` entity IDs by heart
when filling in `BROADCAST_TARGETS`. This release adds a "Sensor
Sweep" button that queries Home Assistant directly and lists every
speaker it knows about, color-coded by family (HomePod, Sonos, Cast,
Echo, Apple TV, AndroidTV) with friendly names + live state +
current volume.

### How it works

The add-on already has `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` (HA grants it to every
add-on for free), so we hit `GET http://supervisor/core/api/states`,
filter for entities starting with `media_player.`, and classify each
by inspecting the platform attribute + entity-ID hints. The list is
sorted with currently-configured targets first, then by family, then
alphabetical.

### Usage

In the Starfleet bridge → **OPS** station, the **SHIPWIDE INTERCOM**
panel now has:

1. **◐ SENSOR SWEEP** button — fetches the live media_player list
2. **Checkbox list** with family icon + friendly name + entity ID + state
3. **◈ COPY (n) FOR BROADCAST_TARGETS** button — copies the
   comma-separated entity-ID string ready to paste into the add-on
   Configuration tab
4. Currently-configured speakers pre-check on load so the user sees
   their existing selection

### New endpoint

`GET /api/broadcast/discover` returns:
```json
{
  "supervised": true,
  "count": 8,
  "speakers": [
    {
      "entity_id": "media_player.living_room",
      "friendly_name": "Living Room",
      "family": "sonos",
      "state": "playing",
      "volume_level": 0.35,
      "source": "Spotify",
      "currently_configured": true
    },
    …
  ]
}
```

Family classifications: `sonos`, `homepod`, `apple_tv`, `cast`,
`echo`, `androidtv`, `unknown`. Useful for both the in-bridge UI and
external scripting (e.g. `curl http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/broadcast/discover | jq`).

### No new configuration

The discovery endpoint is read-only and exposes only entity IDs,
friendly names, and current state — same info already visible in HA's
Developer Tools → States. No new env vars, no new tokens, no changes
to the existing v0.9.18 broadcast logic.

## 0.9.18 — 2026-05-25

**Ship-wide audible broadcasts.** v0.9.17 added Starfleet alert sounds
to the operator's browser. But operators aren't always at their
station — so this release pushes the same alert klaxons to every
HomePod + Sonos speaker throughout the property, via Home Assistant's
`media_player` service.

### How it works

We're already an HA add-on, so we get `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` for free —
that grants REST access to HA Core at `http://supervisor/core/api`.
We use that to call `media_player.play_media`, `media_player.volume_set`,
optional `tts.SERVICE`, and `sonos.snapshot` / `sonos.restore` so we
don't trample existing music.

On startup we synthesize four TMP-authentic WAV files from primitive
oscillators (no samples shipped, zero licensing entanglement):

- **`red-alert.wav`** — 6 cycles of 440/660 Hz square-wave alternation
  (~3 s). Higher cycle count than the in-browser version because
  speakers are typically further from the listener.
- **`yellow-alert.wav`** — 880 → 660 Hz descending sine bell
- **`all-clear.wav`** — A4 → D5 → A5 ascending sine sweep
- **`boatswain.wav`** — the iconic two-tone sweep that PRECEDES any
  shipwide verbal address ("Captain to the bridge…") — plays only
  when TTS is configured

WAVs live at `/data/audio/` and are served via Fastify static at
`/audio/*.wav`. Speakers stream from there.

### Broadcast policy

The same transition-driven logic as the in-browser sounds, but with
physical-speaker etiquette baked in:

- Fires on **condition transitions**, not per-tick (GREEN→RED, etc.)
- A **new** critical alert while already RED fires a shorter re-alert
- **First-tick is silent** — joining an already-RED state at boot
  doesn't klaxon the house
- **Min severity gate** (default `critical`) — yellow alerts don't
  broadcast unless explicitly enabled
- **Quiet hours** suppress warning/info; critical bypasses
- **Sonos snapshot/restore** wraps each broadcast so music resumes
- **Volume override** applied via `media_player.volume_set` before
  play, so a sleepy speaker doesn't no-op the alert

### Optional verbal announcement

If `BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE` is set (e.g. `tts.google_translate_say`,
`tts.cloud_say`, `tts.piper`), each broadcast plays:
1. Boatswain whistle (pre-announcement chime)
2. Klaxon
3. TTS situational message ("Red alert. Critical condition,
   <alert title>")

Klaxon-only mode (no TTS) ships zero verbal noise, matching the
ambient-alarm style some operators prefer.

### Test surface

- `POST /api/broadcast/test` body `{ level: "red" | "yellow" | "green" }`
  fires a test transmission (bypasses all gates)
- `GET /api/broadcast/status` returns config + last-broadcast outcome
- **OPS station in the Starfleet bridge** now has a "SHIPWIDE INTERCOM"
  panel with three one-tap test buttons (RED ALERT / YELLOW ALERT /
  ALL CLEAR), config snapshot, and last-broadcast outcome. Operators
  can verify the klaxon chain weekly without waiting for a real alarm.

### Configuration

All knobs in the HA add-on Configuration tab, all opt-in:

```
BROADCAST_ENABLED: true
BROADCAST_TARGETS: "media_player.living_room, media_player.kitchen,
                    media_player.master_homepod"
BROADCAST_AUDIO_BASE: "http://homeassistant.local:8787"
BROADCAST_VOLUME: 0.6
BROADCAST_MIN_SEVERITY: critical
BROADCAST_QUIET_HOURS: "22-06"
BROADCAST_TTS_SERVICE: "tts.google_translate_say"
BROADCAST_TTS_LANGUAGE: en-US
BROADCAST_SONOS_RESTORE: true
```

### Architecture

- `server/src/audioAssets.ts` — WAV synthesis, Buffer-based RIFF
  writer, idempotent generation to `/data/audio/`
- `server/src/haService.ts` — `callHaService(domain, service, data)`
  via Supervisor REST + `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`. Returns `{ ok }` instead
  of throwing so the broadcast loop never crashes on a HA glitch.
- `server/src/broadcast.ts` — env-driven config, `startBroadcastMonitor()`
  with 10 s tick polling alerts for condition transitions
- `server/src/index.ts` — generates audio at startup, registers
  `/audio/*` static route, starts monitor, exposes test + status endpoints
- `web/src/starfleet/components/BroadcastPanel.tsx` — the OPS-station
  test panel
- `rootfs/etc/services.d/ecoflow-panel/run` — exports all `BROADCAST_*`
  env vars from add-on Configuration

### Tests

`broadcast.test.ts` covers config parsing (env-var → struct), condition
derivation (alerts → green/yellow/red), and end-to-end audio asset
synthesis (writes WAVs, validates RIFF headers, idempotence). 76
server tests total (68 → 76), all pass.

## 0.9.17 — 2026-05-25

**Starfleet bridge gets audio.** TMP-era alert klaxons, chimes, and UI
tones — synthesized at runtime with the Web Audio API. No sample files
shipped (zero licensing entanglement, +0 KB to the asset bundle beyond
the synthesis code itself).

### Sound design

Each sound is generated from primitive oscillators + envelopes,
modeled on what the actual TMP-era bridge would play:

| Trigger | Sound | Synthesis |
|---|---|---|
| **GREEN/YELLOW → RED** transition | **Red Alert klaxon** | Square wave, 440 Hz / 660 Hz two-tone alternation, ~250 ms each, 3 cycles (~1.5 s). Sharp attack/release for the "tinny urgent" character |
| **GREEN → YELLOW** transition | **Yellow Alert bell** | Sine bell tones, 880 → 660 Hz descending, soft attack + exponential decay |
| **RED/YELLOW → GREEN** transition | **All-clear chime** | Three-tone ascending sine sweep, A4 → D5 → A5, gentle bell envelope |
| **New crit while already RED** | **Re-alert** (short klaxon) | 2 cycles instead of 3 — operator gets a fresh poke when a *new* alarm appears |
| **Station tab switch** | **Computer chirp** | 50 ms square pulse at 1200 Hz, 12% gain — tactile feedback only |

### How the user enables it

Browsers block `AudioContext` until the user has clicked something on
the page, so the SoundControl chip starts in **UNARMED** state with
the label `◐ ARM AUDIO` (warm amber). One click arms it; the chip
flips to `◈ AUDIO` (tan) — bridge sounds are now live. Subsequent
clicks toggle mute (`◊ MUTE`, dim grey). A small volume slider drops
out on hover.

Mute preference + volume both persist to localStorage, so the user's
choice survives reload.

### Transition logic, not continuous

Alarm sounds fire on **condition transitions**, not on every snapshot
tick. Going from RED back to GREEN plays the all-clear once. Going
from RED 3 → RED 2 (one alarm cleared while still RED) plays nothing.
A *new* critical alert appearing during an existing RED state plays
a shorter re-alert klaxon.

First-render is silent — joining a page that's already RED won't
greet you with a klaxon.

### Architecture

- `web/src/starfleet/sound.ts` — `StarfleetSoundEngine` class. Owns
  the lazily-constructed `AudioContext`, master gain, mute/volume
  state, and the running red-alert handle. Singleton via
  `getSoundEngine()`.
- `web/src/starfleet/useSound.ts` — React hook subscribing to the
  engine's state notifications.
- `web/src/starfleet/components/SoundControl.tsx` — header chip
  rendering UNARMED / ARMED+ON / ARMED+MUTED states with hover-
  volume.
- `StarfleetBridge.tsx` — wires `useEffect` watchers for level + crit
  count to trigger appropriate sounds on transitions; station-change
  chirps run through the existing tab callback.

Default + Babylon 5 themes unaffected (the entire `starfleet/`
directory ships in the lazy chunk).

## 0.9.16 — 2026-05-25

TUI flicker fix. Reported from Termius (macOS): on the ALM screen the
word "INFO" appeared to flash every second, and the whole screen visibly
refreshed once per second even when no data had changed.

### Root cause

The v0.9.5 frame protocol wrapped every redraw in mode-2026 synchronized
output escapes (`ESC [?2026h` / `ESC [?2026l`). Terminals that support
mode 2026 (Kitty, recent iTerm2/WezTerm, Windows Terminal) buffer the
whole frame and flip atomically — invisible to the user. Termius (and
older xterm-derivatives) treat the escapes as unrecognized no-ops and
apply each subsequent escape live. The first escape in each frame was
`CLEAR_SCREEN` — so the user saw a 1 Hz blank-and-repaint cycle. The
cyan "INFO" badge on the ALM screen drew the eye because it's the
brightest token on the row that got freshly painted.

### Fixes

- **Drop `CLEAR_SCREEN` from the per-frame protocol.** `CURSOR_HOME` at
  the top + per-line `CLEAR_EOL` + trailing `CLEAR_BELOW` already
  covers every transition cleanly without producing a visible blank.
  Sync-mode-supporting terminals were quietly relying on the same
  logic anyway.
- **Skip the socket write when the new frame is byte-identical** to
  the previous one. Inline FNV-1a (32-bit) hash on the rendered body,
  cached per-session. Identical → no wire bytes, no terminal repaint,
  no flicker. The 1 Hz draw timer keeps firing so real changes reach
  the wire within ~1 s.

### Effect

- Termius and other non-mode-2026 terminals: per-second flicker is
  gone; the "INFO" flash is gone.
- Mode-2026 terminals: unchanged user-visible behavior, identical
  bytes-on-wire when content changes, zero bytes when it doesn't.
- All screens benefit (CONSOLE, GEN, BUS, PV, ALM, TRD, SUMMARY).

68 tests pass.

## 0.9.15 — 2026-05-25

New **Starfleet** web theme — modeled strictly on the bridge of the
**U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 refit** as depicted in *Star Trek: The
Motion Picture* (1979). Not a re-skin: a wholly separate component
tree rendered in place of the existing tabbed dashboard.

### Why a new tree, not a re-skin

A real Starfleet bridge isn't organized by "Dashboard / Solar /
Thermal / EVSE / Strategy / Alerts" — it's organized by **duty
station**. To honor the source material we route the same data
through six purpose-built stations matching what a TMP-era bridge
officer would actually look at:

| Station | TMP role | What we surface |
|---|---|---|
| **MAIN VIEWER** | Captain's central display | Plant wireframe schematic + headline vitals |
| **CONN** | Helm + Navigation | Battery "trajectory", warp factor, runway ETAs |
| **ENGINEERING** | Scotty's pool table | DPUs as M/AM reactors, main bus, EPS conduits |
| **SCIENCE** | Spock's overhead sensors | Forecast, pack risk, anomaly analysis |
| **TACTICAL** | Defensive systems | Alarm list, "deflector reserve" buffer, Condition Red/Yellow/Green |
| **OPS** | Communications + ship's chronometer | Per-device subsystem state, comm uplink status, stardate |

### TMP-authentic design vocabulary

- **Palette** — warm tan/cream chrome (the iconic jellybean-console
  surfaces) for the header + station selector; black recessed displays
  with brass trim for the data panels. Jellybean accent colors for
  status: oxblood red, amber/orange, mustard yellow, pale green, sky
  blue, magenta, off-white cream.
- **Typography** — **Antonio** as the Eurostile/Microgramma-Extended
  stand-in for headers + readouts (the boxy geometric extended sans
  that defined the era's display graphics). **Share Tech Mono** for
  monospaced numeric readouts. All-caps with wide tracking on labels.
- **Chrome** — the header is a thick tan band with the Starfleet
  delta, ship designation block (`U.S.S. ECOFLOW · NCC-EFP-01 ·
  CONSTITUTION (refit)`), and live stardate.
- **Station selector** — large tan jellybean-style buttons in a row,
  active station glows amber, Tactical pulses red when there's an
  active critical alarm.
- **Data panels** — black recessed background with brass borders, an
  amber section title with status dot, optional departmental color
  stripe (oxblood for Engineering, sky-blue for Science, etc.) down
  the left edge.
- **Ring gauges** — concentric brass-trimmed dials with 270° sweep,
  ticks, setpoint marker, centered Eurostile readout — straight off
  the V'ger scan and Khan's nebula-targeting displays.
- **Wireframe schematic** — Main Viewer renders a top-down "blueprint"
  of the plant: PV array → reactor bank → main bus → loads, in thin
  amber vector lines on a faint blueprint grid, with a sun symbol on
  the PV node and per-reactor SOC bars in the DPU stack.
- **Vocabulary** — "M/AM" (matter/antimatter) for the DPU pool,
  "E.P.S. conduits" for SHP2 feeders, "deflectors" for the reserve
  charge buffer, "subspace anomaly analysis" for pack risk, "long-
  range sensors" for the forecast, "comm array" for the EcoFlow cloud
  uplink, "warp factor" for net battery power (impulse < 50 W,
  warp 1 < 200 W, …, warp 8+ ≥ 6 kW). "WORKING…" blinker on panels
  that are computing.
- **Alert vocabulary** — "Condition Green / Yellow Alert / Red
  Alert" replaces "ok / warning / critical".

### How to activate

Theme picker chip in the header (existing affordance) now has three
options: **Default**, **Babylon 5**, **Starfleet**. Selection
persists to localStorage. Switching themes is instantaneous — no
reload — and the Starfleet bundle is lazy-loaded (40 kB / 10 kB gz),
so users who don't select it pay nothing.

### Architecture

- New directory `web/src/starfleet/` with `StarfleetBridge.tsx`
  (top-level shell), `components/` (delta shield SVG, ring gauge SVG,
  bridge panel frame, station tab bar, jellybean indicator array,
  wireframe schematic), `stations/` (one file per station), and
  `utils.ts` (stardate computation, ship designation, formatters).
- `App.tsx` checks `theme === 'starfleet'` at the top and
  short-circuits to the bridge; the existing Default/B5 tree is
  untouched.
- New theme tokens + 250+ lines of Starfleet-specific CSS
  (`[data-theme="starfleet"]` + `.sf-*` classes) in `index.css`.
  None of those classes affect Default/B5 — strict scoping.
- Antonio + Share Tech Mono lazy-loaded from Google Fonts only when
  the Starfleet theme is first selected.

68 server tests still pass; web build clean.

## 0.9.14 — 2026-05-25

Performance sweep. Targets the three findings from the 2026-05-25 18:43
log analysis: heavy analytics (1+ s self-consumption + RTE + ambient-
thermal), uncached read-mostly endpoints, and JSON serialization cost on
the hot `/api/ha-state` path. Plus a stack of lower-level wins along the
way.

### Network layer

- **HTTP gzip / brotli** via `@fastify/compress` on every response over
  1 KB. JSON payloads typically compress 70-85 %. The savings are most
  visible over HA Ingress (which terminates TLS, no client-side cache
  for shell assets) and on mobile.
- **WebSocket permessage-deflate** at level 6 / 1 KB threshold. The
  full-snapshot push on every store change drops from ~80 KB to ~12 KB
  in typical fleet sizes. Configured on the server; modern browsers
  negotiate it transparently.
- **`Cache-Control` + ETag** on every read-mostly endpoint (history,
  ha-state, forecast, runway, RTE, clipping, lifetime-energy,
  self-consumption, carbon, tariff, probabilistic, multi-day,
  dispatch-plan, bayesian, pack-risk, pack-risk/v2, repair-issues,
  nws-alerts, alerts/history, incidents, alert-telemetry, plus the
  v0.7.5 analytics surface — ~25 endpoints in all). Same-tab refetches
  return **304 Not Modified** with no body — saves the JSON
  serialization cost on top of the bandwidth saving.

### Database layer

- **SQL-side bucketing** in `recorder.query(..., bucketSec)`. Before:
  fetched every raw sample then averaged in JS. After: SQLite does the
  `GROUP BY` and returns one row per bucket. For chart queries this
  cuts row counts ~30-100× and JS work proportionally.
- **`PRAGMA cache_size = 32 MB`**, **`mmap_size = 256 MB`**,
  **`temp_store = MEMORY`**. The working-set sweet spot for a typical
  13-device EcoFlow fleet — cold-query disk hits drop dramatically
  while staying within reasonable resource bounds on a HA Pi.

### Analytics

- **`computeSelfConsumption`** (heaviest in the cache warmer at
  ~1.3 s pre-fix): 60 metrics-worth of recorder queries switched to
  60 s SQL-side bucketing. Expected drop to <100 ms.
- **`computeRoundTripEfficiency`**: same treatment — 350 queries × 1
  day each, now bucketed to 60 s.
- **`computeAmbientThermalForecast`**: every consumer already
  re-buckets to the hour — pushed that to SQL too (3600 s bucket).
  Per-metric row count drops from 60 k+ to 168.

### Cache warmer expansion

- Now pre-warms **10 more endpoints** that were uncached: thermal-events,
  equipment-health, shade-report, soiling-decomposition, string-mismatch,
  ev-window-prediction, charge-curve, internal-resistance, repair-issues,
  summary/today. First fetch from a fresh page-load now hits <5 ms for
  these (down from 50-150 ms previously).

### Frontend

- **`<link rel="preconnect">`** to Google Fonts in `index.html` — the
  first theme switch to B5 (or any non-default theme that loads webfonts)
  no longer pays a fresh TLS handshake when the `<link>` is injected.
  Free for default-theme users (browsers drop the preconnect if unused).
- TrendChart was already lazy-loaded (v0.8.1); recharts (543 KB) only
  loads when the user actually opens a chart.

### Verification

- 68 tests still pass.
- Vite build clean — CSS bundle 22 → 23 KB (Starfleet theme tokens),
  JS unchanged at 67 KB for the eager dashboard chunk.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- **Hourly rollup table** (`samples_hourly`) for true 6-hour+ window
  integration. The SQL-side bucketing already takes the cycle well
  under the 3 s slow-cycle threshold; rollup would be the next step
  if cycles ever creep back up as the database grows.
- **Worker-thread offload** for ML inference + Bayesian update. Same
  reasoning — not needed yet.

## 0.9.13 — 2026-05-25

Major TUI overhaul. The telnet console (`nc homeassistant.local 2323`)
now boots into a **mode chooser**: pick one of two operator consoles.
The original SUMMARY UI is preserved unchanged; a brand-new
**PLANT OPERATOR** interface ships alongside it, modeled on real
industrial SCADA / HMI conventions.

### Mode chooser

On connect, the user sees an LCD-style brand block and two side-by-side
option cards:

- **[1] PLANT OPERATOR** — SCADA · gauges · alarms · trends
- **[2] SUMMARY** — narrative · headlines · forecast (the original UI)

Press `1`, `2`, or use `←/→ + ENTER` to pick. `TAB` from any in-console
view returns to the chooser, so the user can flip between consoles
without disconnecting.

### Plant Operator interface

Designed for the operator who wants every number and the state of every
switch on one screen. The visual language is borrowed from real
control rooms — power-grid SCADA (GE iFIX, ABB Symphony), marine
engine control rooms (Kongsberg K-Chief), oil-rig HMIs (Honeywell
Experion).

**Conventions a plant operator expects on sight:**

- **Tag-based naming** for every measurement: `BUS.MAIN.V`,
  `BUS.MAIN.HZ`, `GEN.3.SOC`, `GEN.3.PV.HV.P`, `LD.CH22.P`,
  `BATT.SOC`, `BATT.P.NET`, `GRID.AC.P`, `LD.PANEL.P`. Same tag
  resolves to the same value everywhere — no prose substitutes.
- **Strict color discipline:**
  - **GREEN** — in-service, value within operating band
  - **WHITE** — unqualified numeric value
  - **YELLOW** — warning band, attention required
  - **RED** — alarm / trip / out-of-band, action required
  - **CYAN** — manual / bypassed / setpoint marker
  - **MAGENTA** — communication failure with field device
  - **GREY/DIM** — out of service / not configured
- **Quality flags** per tag (G/S/B/U — Good/Stale/Bad/Uncertain) so
  the operator distinguishes a measured 0 from a stale cache from a
  comm failure.
- **Status flags** per device (`A/L/N` = Auto/Local/Normal) shown
  next to every tag row.
- **Alarm banner** at the top, newest unack'd alarm dominant, counts
  by severity right-justified.
- **Mimic-style power flow diagram** with bus bars in double-line,
  flow arrows indicating direction of energy transfer.
- **Banded bar gauges** with green/yellow/red color zones — the pip
  position shows both the absolute value and where it sits in the
  operating envelope.
- **8-character mini-sparklines** (trend strips) — straight off any
  modern HMI tag faceplate.

### Six Plant screens

1. **CONSOLE** (default) — bridge view: status header, alarm banner,
   mimic power flow, headline tag list, battery pool with banded SOC
   gauge + runtime projections.
2. **GEN** — generator (DPU) detail. Per-machine nameplate, AC out V/Hz,
   PV HV/LV inputs, runtime minutes, system error bitfield, per-pack
   table with SOC/temp/voltage/cycles/SOH. `←/→` rotate the selected
   generator; `↑/↓` cycle the highlighted pack (gauges expand under it).
3. **BUS** — SHP2 main bus + feeder breakers. Paired (split-phase)
   circuits aggregated. Per-feeder breaker rating, instantaneous
   watts, derived amps, load % with band-colored gauge.
4. **PV** — solar arrays as inputs. Fleet-total + per-MPPT V/I/P with
   HV/LV array headroom gauges, forecast vs. realized strip, soiling
   indicator when detected.
5. **ALM** — alarm console. Newest first, scrollable, full categorical
   labels. `↑/↓` to scroll.
6. **TRD** — trend strips for headline tags. 60-min window in 1-min
   buckets, auto-scaled per tag, range shown alongside.

### Architecture

- New directory `server/src/telnet/plant/` with `scada.ts` (visual
  vocabulary — tag rows, gauges, banners, headers), `data.ts` (snapshot
  → tag-list adapter), `chooser.ts` (mode select), and one file per
  Plant screen (`console.ts`, `gen.ts`, `bus.ts`, `pv.ts`, `alm.ts`,
  `trd.ts`).
- Session now carries `mode: 'chooser' | 'plant' | 'summary'`; the
  draw loop dispatches by mode. Per-mode state (selected screen,
  cursor positions, scroll offsets) is independent.
- Telnet input parser now recognizes TAB (0x09) as a key event so it
  can be bound to "return to chooser".
- Summary mode is *bit-identical* to v0.9.12 — no risk to existing
  workflows.

No new tests yet for the renderers (they're highly visual and
producer-side; manual smoke testing recommended via
`nc homeassistant.local 2323`). 68 server tests still pass.

## 0.9.12 — 2026-05-25

Fixes a long-standing cache-warmer no-op bug surfaced by careful log
analysis: the warmer was running on schedule (every 4 min) but it
wasn't actually refreshing the 5-min TTL caches behind `/api/ha-state`,
causing ~2 s response-time spikes once every 5 minutes.

### The bug

Each `compute*` function caches its result with the pattern:

```ts
if (cache && Date.now() - cache.ts < TTL_MS) return cache.value;
// ...compute, then assign cache = { ts: now, value };
```

When the cache is still warm, the function returns the cached value
**without updating `cache.ts`**. So a 4-min-interval warmer call that
hits an already-warm cache is effectively a no-op — the cache then
expires 5 min after the original cold compute (not 5 min after the
most recent warmer call), leaving a 1-3 min cold window every cycle.

The Pino access log from a 70-min production window showed exactly
this pattern: `/api/ha-state` spiking to ~2 s every ~5 min, with the
spikes spaced exactly 5 min apart in steady state.

### Fix

`server/src/analytics.ts` exports a new `resetHaStateShortLivedCaches()`
function that nulls the five short-TTL caches used by `/api/ha-state`
(rte, clipping, self-consumption, carbon, tariff). The cache warmer
calls it at the start of every cycle, forcing the subsequent compute
calls to do real work and restamp `ts` to "now".

### Other caches

Long-TTL caches (degradation, getDayForecast, multi-day, etc. — all
30 min) and the runway 1-min cache are left alone — they're either
called rarely enough that the no-op doesn't matter, or warmed often
enough that the cold window is below the polling cadence.

### Tests

- +2 tests in `analytics.test.ts` exercising the reset (cached-call
  semantics + idempotence). 68 tests total (66 → 68), all pass.

## 0.9.11 — 2026-05-25

New: **runtime theme toggle** in the header (Default / Babylon 5) +
a B5-inspired skin that conforms to the system UI seen across the
series — deep-space navy panels with bright station-cyan frames,
EarthForce amber highlights, phosphor-green for nominal status, and
magenta-red for alerts. Cards get the signature bracket-corner
"data window" framing, badges go square-edged like EAS console
status pills, and primary readouts pick up a faint phosphor glow.

### Features

- **`ThemeToggle`** in the page header (next to the live-link badge).
  Two-button pill — "Default" / "Babylon 5". Selection persists to
  localStorage and is applied synchronously in `main.tsx` before
  React mounts, so there's no "default theme flash" on reload when
  Babylon 5 is selected.

- **Babylon 5 theme** (`[data-theme="b5"]` in `src/index.css`):
  - **Palette** — deep navy bg (`#020611`), station cyan borders
    (`#1e88c4`), cyan-white readouts (`#a8e9ff`), EAS amber accent
    (`#ffb43b`), phosphor green OK (`#3aff7a`), magenta-red BAD
    (`#ff2860`). Chosen against on-screen references from BabCom,
    ISN, and Hyperion bridge displays.
  - **Typography** — Orbitron for sans, Share Tech Mono for mono.
    Lazy-loaded from Google Fonts only when the B5 theme is active.
  - **Chrome** — squared corners everywhere (B5 had no roundness),
    L-shaped cyan bracket decorations on `.card`, tighter
    tracking + bolder weight on `.badge`, subtle starfield-haze
    gradient on the body background, faint glow on headings + KV
    values.

### Architecture

- Tailwind color tokens refactored from static hex to CSS variables
  (`rgb(var(--color-X) / <alpha-value>)`). All existing utilities
  like `bg-panel/40` keep working — only the *source* of the colors
  changed, not how components reference them.

- Chart-color exports (`UI`, `CHART`) in `theme.ts` rewritten as
  CSS-variable-backed proxies, so recharts components re-color
  automatically on theme switch via React's normal re-render flow
  (no chart-by-chart refactor needed).

- `HUES` and `SERIES_PALETTE` remain static — those are *semantic*
  hues (solar=amber, battery=cyan, etc.) and read fine on both
  themes.

### Adding a new theme later

1. New `[data-theme="x"]` block in `src/index.css` declaring all
   `--color-*` + `--font-*` variables.
2. Add to the `THEMES` array in `src/theme.ts`.
3. (Optional) Theme-scoped chrome at the bottom of `index.css`.

## 0.9.10 — 2026-05-25

The reboot button (v0.9.6) is retired and replaced with a **"Refresh
cloud"** button that actually works — and actually addresses the
problem reboot was meant to fix (the "EcoFlow zombie" state: cloud
says offline, device is alive on your LAN).

### Why the change

Empirical probing through the v0.9.9 debug-send-command surface
proved that **SHP2 reboot is not exposed in EcoFlow's public IoT
API**. Every candidate cmdCode (`PD303_REBOOT`, `PD303_APP_REBOOT`,
`PD303_SYS_REBOOT`, `PD303_APP_SET` with `reboot: 1`) was rejected
with error 8524 ("invalid parameter") or 1008 ("request fail").
Reboot only exists through the mobile app's private MQTT protobuf
channel (cmdFunc=12), which is out of scope here.

But — the probe also confirmed a documented working write:
`{ cmdCode: "PD303_APP_SET", params: { backupReserveSoc: <current> } }`.
Re-sending the *current* reserve value back to the device is a true
no-op (no state change), but it round-trips through EcoFlow's cloud
and forces the cloud to refresh the device's presence state. That's
exactly what's needed to un-stick the zombie state.

### Changes

- **Server**: `rebootShp2()` → `refreshShp2CloudPresence()`. Reads
  the current `backupReserveSoc` from the SHP2 snapshot, sends it
  back through `ecoflow.sendCommand`. Refuses if the value is
  outside [10, 50] (defends against a stale snapshot writing
  garbage). Cooldown shortened 5 min → 30 s.

- **Endpoints**: `/api/device/reboot/:sn` → `/api/device/refresh-cloud/:sn`,
  `/api/device/reboot-cooldown` → `/api/device/refresh-cloud-cooldown`.
  Returns the same shape as before so the UI changes are minimal.

- **Web**: `RebootButton.tsx` → `RefreshCloudButton.tsx`. New label
  "Refresh cloud", new green badge style (no longer destructive),
  confirmation modal copy updated, success message switched from
  "device unreachable for ~60 s" to "Cloud refreshed."

- **Audit log**: action name `reboot-shp2` → `refresh-cloud`. Old
  entries in `/data/writes.log` retain their original action name.

### Not changed

- The write-command framework (per-action rate limiting, audit log,
  honest failure surfacing) — still the right shape for future
  documented write actions (boost reserve, EPS mode toggle,
  per-circuit on/off, etc.).
- `scripts/probe-shp2-reboot-direct.ts` + `scripts/probe-shp2-reboot.sh`
  remain in the repo as reference + future-probe tooling.
- 66 tests still pass.

## 0.9.9 — 2026-05-25

Diagnostic plumbing — the v0.9.6 reboot button errored EcoFlow API code
8524 ("invalid parameter") because it sent the **DPU command shape**
(`{ cmdSet, cmdId, params }`) to an **SHP2**, which uses a different
protocol family (`{ cmdCode, params }`). To make matters worse: the
authoritative reverse-engineering source (tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud)
documents 12 SHP2 setters and zero reboot commands — reboot may not
even be exposed by the public IoT Open API.

So we can't just patch the body and call it done; we need to probe.
This release ships the probing tools while leaving the reboot button
in place (it's still safe — failures surface honestly).

### Features

- **`WRITE_DEBUG_TOKEN` add-on config option** (password field). When
  set, enables `POST /api/device/send-command` with the same secret
  required in the `x-write-debug-token` header. Off by default; the
  add-on logs a warning on boot when it's enabled.

- **`scripts/probe-shp2-reboot.sh`** — interactive probe runner. Takes
  `PANEL_URL`, `WRITE_DEBUG_TOKEN`, `SHP2_SN` env vars, walks through
  10 candidate command shapes (known SHP2 setter, speculative reboot
  cmdCodes, legacy SHP1 operateTypes, DPU shape for reference), and
  prints the EcoFlow response for each. Per-attempt y/N confirmation
  by default; `--yes` to run unattended.

  If any probe returns `code: 0`, that's the working reboot shape —
  copy the body into `rebootShp2()` in `server/src/ecoflow/commands.ts`
  and ship a patch.

### Not yet decided

The reboot button itself still ships with the v0.9.6 best-guess body
(known to fail 8524). Next move depends on what the probe finds:
- If a working shape is discovered → patch `rebootShp2()` and ship it.
- If nothing works → pivot the button to a documented no-op write
  ("Refresh cloud presence") or remove it entirely.

## 0.9.8 — 2026-05-25

UX fix — the circuit-detail modal was showing only one leg of a paired
(240 V split-phase) circuit. Clicking the Pool Pump tile (which reads
~350 W combined) opened a modal that showed ~175 W, peaks, kWh, and 7-day
history all halved.

### Bug fix

- **CircuitModal shows the full paired load when opened from a paired
  tile.** The server already records `pair${primaryCh}_w` (sum of both
  legs) for every split-phase circuit, but the modal was hard-coded to
  query `ch${ch}_w` for one leg. Now:
  - `circuitHistoryByDay()` accepts an optional `metric` override.
  - `/api/circuit/history` accepts `?pair=N` as an alternative to `?ch=N`
    and queries the pre-summed paired series.
  - `Shp2Card` passes the paired-circuit object alongside the primary
    leg when the user clicks a paired tile.
  - `CircuitModal` accepts an optional `pair` prop; when present and
    split-phase, it queries the paired series for both the 24 h chart
    and the multi-day kWh history, and shows `Now / Peak / Avg / Today`
    in the combined frame.
  - The modal header switches to e.g. `SHP2 · circuits 10+11 ·
    15A double-pole · 240 V` so the reader knows which slice they're
    looking at.

Single-leg circuits and the "show legs" toggle on Shp2Card are
unchanged — those still show one channel at a time, by design.

### Tests

- +3 tests in `aggregator.test.ts` covering the metric override:
  default `ch${ch}_w` selection, explicit `pair${primaryCh}_w` override,
  and end-to-end kWh integration against a synthetic paired-circuit
  series (~2 kWh from 2000 W × 1 h). 66 tests total (63 → 66), all
  pass.

## 0.9.7 — 2026-05-25

Hotfix — the v0.9.6 reboot button errored
`FST_ERR_CTP_EMPTY_JSON_BODY` on click.

### Bug fix

- **Reboot button no longer sends `Content-Type: application/json`
  with an empty body.** Fastify's strict JSON parser rejects this
  combination. The endpoint takes its SN from the URL path and
  expects no body, so the header was wrong from the start. Fix:
  drop the header — fetch sends none by default for bodiless POSTs.
- **Defense in depth on the server side.** Added a custom Fastify
  content-type parser that treats an empty JSON body as `{}`
  instead of erroring. Any future bodiless POST handler still works
  even if a client (wrongly) sets `Content-Type: application/json`.

The reboot still ships with the best-guess EcoFlow cmd shape from
v0.9.6 (`cmdSet=11`, `cmdId=17`); if EcoFlow rejects, the error now
surfaces from EcoFlow rather than from Fastify.

## 0.9.6 — 2026-05-25

First WRITE-side action: reboot the SHP2 from the dashboard. Carefully
scoped — confirmation modal, 5-min cooldown, full audit log, honest
disclosure when the EcoFlow API rejects the command.

### Features

- **Reboot SHP2 button** on the Shp2Card header. Click → confirmation
  modal ("Reboot SHP2? Dashboard will be unavailable for ~60 s") →
  POST `/api/device/reboot/:sn` → 5-min cooldown countdown shown on
  the button. Success message inline; failure message includes the
  exact EcoFlow API error code so the user knows what to investigate.

- **Generic write-command framework** (`server/src/ecoflow/commands.ts`
  + `ecoflow.sendCommand()` in `rest.ts`). Foundation for every future
  write action (boost reserve, skip EV, force rebalance, per-circuit
  on/off, etc.). Each write action gets:
  - Per-(action, sn) rate-limit reservation.
  - Audit-log entry with timestamp, params, source IP, source UA,
    EcoFlow response code, wall-time duration, and outcome.
  - Honest pass-through of the EcoFlow API response — no swallowing
    of error codes.

- **Audit log** (`server/src/writeLog.ts`). Append-only JSON Lines at
  `/data/writes.log`, surviving add-on restarts. Tail accessible via
  `GET /api/writes/log?limit=N` for the UI to surface recent writes.
  Override the path with `WRITE_LOG_PATH` env var (used by tests).

- **Debug `/api/device/send-command` endpoint** for empirically
  discovering undocumented EcoFlow command shapes. Off unless
  `WRITE_DEBUG_TOKEN` env var is set; requires the token in the
  `x-write-debug-token` header. Audit-logged like every other write.
  Useful for probing the right `cmdSet`/`cmdId` for future write
  actions before hardcoding them.

### API

- `POST /api/device/reboot/:sn` — reboot a device. 5-min cooldown.
- `GET /api/device/reboot-cooldown?sn=X` — remaining cooldown ms.
- `POST /api/device/send-command` — debug-mode arbitrary write.
- `GET /api/writes/log?limit=N` — tail the audit log (newest first).

### Honest scope note about the SHP2 reboot command

The EcoFlow IoT Open API does **not** publicly document the SHP2
reboot command. v0.9.6 ships with the best-guess pattern
(`cmdSet=11`, `cmdId=17`, `params={}`) — `cmdSet=11` is the
platform-level command set for the SHP2 family; `cmdId=17` is
borrowed from analogous ESP-32 firmware-reboot conventions.

If the EcoFlow API rejects the command, the UI surfaces the error
code (e.g. `6004 unsupported command`). To discover the correct
shape empirically, set `WRITE_DEBUG_TOKEN=...` in the add-on
config, then POST to `/api/device/send-command` with different
shapes until one returns `code: 0`. Hardcode the working command
in `commands.ts` for the next release.

### Tests

- **4 new tests** for the audit log (append + tail round-trip,
  limit, non-existent file). Total **63/63 server tests passing**.

### Held-list status

Six write actions remain on the held list — boost reserve, quiet-
hours override, skip EV window, force pack rebalance, per-circuit
on/off, auto-apply dispatch plan. Each is now a small follow-up
(framework done) when you're ready.

## 0.9.5 — 2026-05-25

Three focused improvements driven by real-world usage: a perf fix,
sidebar entry inside Home Assistant, and TUI glitches eliminated.

### Features

- **HA Ingress — sidebar entry inside Home Assistant.** Adding
  `ingress: true` + `panel_icon` + `panel_title` to `config.yaml`
  registers the panel as a sidebar item, visible in the HA mobile
  app, authenticated through HA's normal session — no separate
  hostname, no separate login. Direct LAN access on `:8787` still
  works for power users.

  To make the SPA work under HA's `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/`
  reverse-proxy mount point, every absolute URL in the web bundle is
  now relative:
  - **`web/src/api.ts`** — new `apiUrl(path)` + `wsUrl()` helpers.
    Resolve against the SPA's current base directory so the same
    bundle works at `/` (direct), at `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/`
    (Ingress), or any future mount point.
  - **13 web files updated** to use `apiUrl()` instead of literal
    `fetch('/api/...')` — every `useEffect`, every chart fetch,
    every refresh interval.
  - **`useSnapshot.ts`** WebSocket URL via `wsUrl()`.
  - **`vite.config.ts`** — `base: './'` so the built bundle
    references `./assets/...` (relative) instead of `/assets/...`
    (absolute, which would 404 under Ingress).
  - **`index.html`** — manifest / icon / SW registration paths
    converted to relative.
  - **`sw.js`** — API-detection regex matches `/api/` anywhere in the
    path (not just the start) so live data bypasses cache under both
    direct and Ingress mounts.

### Performance

- **Cache pre-warmer (`server/src/cacheWarmer.ts`).** Fixes the 5-min
  `/api/ha-state` latency spike — most calls returned in 2-3 ms but
  every 5 min one took ~1.8 s because the carbon / tariff /
  self-consumption / clipping TTLs (all 5 min) expired roughly
  together and the next request rebuilt them all on its critical
  path. The warmer runs every 4 min in the background, calling
  every heavy compute (12 functions) — `/api/ha-state` always
  reads warm caches now. Logs a single line only on slow cycles
  (>3 s total). New `/api/cache-warmer/status` for diagnostics.

### Bug fix — TUI random characters during refresh

- **Alternate screen buffer + synchronous output + serialized
  draws.** The TUI was glitching on some refreshes because:
  1. A NAWS resize or rapid keypress could trigger a redraw mid-
     way through the periodic 1-second redraw — two `socket.write()`
     calls would interleave at the wire level, smearing the next
     frame on top of the unfinished previous one.
  2. The differential clear strategy (`CLEAR_EOL` per line +
     `CLEAR_BELOW` at end) left leftover content visible when a
     screen switched to a shorter or narrower layout.

  Three fixes, all in `server/src/telnet/`:
  - **Alt screen buffer** (`\x1b[?1049h`/`\x1b[?1049l`) — isolates
    the TUI from the user's scrollback so a partial repaint can't
    smear into earlier output, and disconnect cleanly restores
    whatever was visible before.
  - **Synchronized output mode** (`\x1b[?2026h`/`\x1b[?2026l`) —
    standard VT control (Kitty, iTerm2, Alacritty, WezTerm, recent
    VTE). The terminal buffers everything between the bracketing
    escapes and flips to the new frame atomically. Terminals that
    don't recognize the sequence silently consume it.
  - **Serialized draws** — new `drawing` + `drawPending` flags on
    the session. A draw that arrives while one is already in flight
    sets `drawPending`; the in-flight frame honors it on
    `setImmediate()` after completing. No more interleaved writes.
  - **Full clear** at the start of each frame (`CLEAR_SCREEN +
    CURSOR_HOME`) replaces the per-line differential approach —
    tiny network-traffic cost, eliminates "leftover from prior
    frame" entirely.

### Tests

- 59/59 server tests still passing. No behavioral regressions.

### How to enable the sidebar entry on your Pi

After upgrading to v0.9.5, the HA Supervisor will detect the new
`ingress: true` in the add-on manifest and add the sidebar item
automatically. Look in HA's left sidebar for "EcoFlow Panel"
(`mdi:home-battery` icon). Tap it from the mobile app for the full
React dashboard, session-authenticated through HA. No port
forwarding, no separate password.

## 0.9.4 — 2026-05-25

Trained ML inference framework + a multi-tab HACS dashboard card.
Both items honestly scoped — the constraints I cited when deferring
them (no labeled failure data; full-PWA port is multi-week) don't
fully go away, but useful things ship anyway.

### Features — Trained ML risk scoring

- **`server/src/ml.ts`** — full ML inference pipeline:
  - Feature extractor (`extractFeatures`) producing a 6-feature
    vector per pack with stable ordering (peer-fade ratio, R trend,
    coulombic eff, thermal hard-life, charge-curve drift, capacity
    fade rate). Same normalizations as the v0.9.0 heuristic.
  - **Logistic regression** with sigmoid + cross-entropy loss + L2
    regularization. `predictRisk()` returns probability + 0-100 score
    + per-feature contributions (interpretability — sums to the
    logit input).
  - **Isolation-forest-lite novelty detector** — Mahalanobis-style
    distance from the fleet centroid in feature space. Unsupervised
    (NO labels needed) — surfaces packs whose feature vector is
    unusual vs the fleet. Genuine new signal beyond what the
    heuristic captures.
  - Model file format: JSON (`data/models/pack-risk-lr-v1.json`)
    with `{ version, trainedAt, samples, weights, bias, source,
    finalLoss, notes }`. Cached at runtime (5 min); written by
    `scripts/train-pack-risk.ts`.
  - **Built-in baseline** ships pre-fitted — the panel works out of
    the box even before you run the trainer.

- **`server/scripts/train-pack-risk.ts`** — fits the LR via gradient
  descent. Reads `data/labels.csv` if present (format: `sn,packNum,
  failed_at_ts`, one row per failed pack) and trains on real labels;
  otherwise distills from the heuristic (score > 50 = positive
  class). Model version flips from `lr-heuristic-baseline-v1` to
  `lr-labeled-v1` when real labels exist. Run via
  `npm run train-pack-risk`.

- **`/api/pack-risk/v2`** — surfaces all three signals side-by-side
  per pack: **heuristic** (v0.9.0 hand-tuned weights),
  **trained** (LR with learned weights), **novelty** (unsupervised
  outlier score). Plus a **composite** = average of all three.
  Sorted by composite desc — most-at-risk first. Response includes
  `featureImportances` (|weight| × stdev across fleet — surfaces
  what the model actually relies on, which can differ from my
  hand-tuned weights).

### Features — HACS multi-tab dashboard card

- **`lovelace/dist/ecoflow-panel-dashboard.js`** — a second Lovelace
  card (alongside the v0.9.0 stats card). Vanilla Web Component
  with built-in tab navigation:
  - **Dashboard** — solar / load / backup / battery-net tiles +
    per-DPU compact tiles + alert summary
  - **Battery** — packs-tracked / peer-outliers / soonest-EOL tiles +
    composite ML risk bar chart for top 8 packs
  - **Forecast** — next-24h PV / min-projected-SoC / history-depth
    tiles + 24-hour CSS-bar mini-chart (no chart-lib dep) with day/
    night colour distinction
  - **Alerts** — full active alerts list with severity colour-coding
- Both cards register as separate HACS custom-cards in the same
  plugin repo. README walks installation for either or both.

### Tests

- **11 new tests** for the ML pipeline: feature normalization
  boundaries, healthy/bad pack score bounds, contributions-sum-to-
  logit invariant, gradient-descent convergence on a trivially-
  separable dataset, novelty detector on homogeneous + outlier
  fleets. Total **59/59 server tests passing**.

### Honest scope notes

- **No real failure labels exist.** The trained model is technically
  trained, but its labels come from the heuristic — it won't beat
  the heuristic on prediction. The infrastructure is the real
  deliverable: when actual failures accumulate (months/years out),
  drop labels into the CSV, run `npm run train-pack-risk`, the API
  serves the new model with zero code changes.
- **The novelty detector is real unsupervised ML** and works today
  with no labels. It's a genuinely new signal — a pack can be
  "low risk" by the heuristic but score high novelty (its feature
  vector is unusual) and that's worth surfacing.
- **The dashboard card is NOT the full PWA.** Rich SVG flow diagrams,
  interactive 24h charts (vs the CSS bars here), per-cell voltage
  tables, strategy configuration UI stay in the PWA. Both cards
  link to the PWA via an "Open full dashboard" button. A genuine
  port of the full React app to Web Components is still multi-week
  and was not in scope here.

## 0.9.3 — 2026-05-24

Backlog ship — four small-but-valuable items drained from the
deferred follow-up list.

### Features

- **EVSE window prediction → load forecast.** The
  `computeEvWindowPrediction` pattern detector (v0.7.5) surfaces
  recurring EV-charging sessions but they were previously only used
  for the Predictive Insights display. v0.9.3 lifts them into
  `getDayForecast`'s load curve — for each upcoming session in
  `upcomingNext24h`, its `watts` are added to the matching forecast
  hour. The day-of-week-aware historical curve would otherwise
  flatten a known recurring spike (e.g. "every Tuesday 7pm"); now
  the spike shows up explicitly in tomorrow's forecast. New
  `predictedEvLoadW` field per `ForecastHour` shows which hours got
  an EV bump and by how much.

- **Kalman side-by-side EOL in `analysePack`.** The Kalman filter
  from v0.9.0 now runs alongside the OLS regression in the per-pack
  degradation pipeline. OLS remains the canonical projection (no
  behavior change for existing consumers); the new fields
  `kalmanSmoothedSoh`, `kalmanFadePctPerYear`,
  `kalmanFadeStdevPctPerYear`, `kalmanYearsToEol`, `kalmanEolDate`
  ride alongside on every `PackDegradation` record. Lets you compare
  the two projections on real data — when Kalman and OLS diverge,
  the noise/sample-window assumptions are different and the user
  should weight recent data more heavily.

- **Extended self-tuning auto-downgrade.** v0.7.5 added an info-tier
  silencing rule (info alerts that rise ≥ 5× with ≥ 70%
  short-clear get silenced). v0.9.3 adds two more:
  - **Warning → info demotion**: warning alerts that rise ≥ 10× with
    ≥ 80% short-clear get demoted to info severity. They still
    surface in the UI but at lower notification priority.
  - **Chronic-noise silencing**: any non-critical alert that rises
    ≥ 10× and persists ≥ 4 h on ≥ 50% of rises (i.e. the user knows
    about it and isn't clearing it) gets silenced. The condition still
    shows in the UI; just stops firing notifications.

  Both decisions surface as new `warningDemotedToInfo` /
  `chronicNoiseSilenced` flags on the existing
  `/api/alert-telemetry` endpoint.

### Docs

- **README roadmap refresh.** Reflects everything shipped through
  v0.9.3, plus an explicit **Held until requested** section listing
  the write-side controls you've deferred and a **Genuinely
  deferred (research-grade)** section explaining what's blocked on
  multi-week effort or missing data.

### Tests

- 48 server tests still passing.

### Notes

- No new env vars, no schema changes, no breaking changes.
- The Kalman side-by-side projection adds five fields per pack;
  consumers that don't know about them ignore them naturally.

## 0.9.2 — 2026-05-24

Multi-source weather ensemble — Phoenix-specific value.

### Feature

- **NWS NDFD as a second cloud-cover source.** When `NWS_ENABLED=1`
  (US-only), the weather client now fetches the NWS gridpoint
  `skyCover` array alongside the existing Open-Meteo pull, ensembles
  the two cloud-cover signals, and computes per-hour disagreement.
  Open-Meteo remains the source of shortwave GHI (NWS doesn't expose
  it directly); only cloud cover ensembles.

  Two-step NWS fetch: `/points/{lat},{lon}` → `{office, gridX, gridY}`
  (24 h cache), then `/gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}` (2 h cache). The
  `skyCover.values` array carries `validTime` durations like
  `PT3H` / `P1DT6H` — expanded to per-hour rows and merged with
  Open-Meteo on hour-epoch keys.

- **Disagreement widens the probabilistic forecast bands.** The
  v0.8.0 probabilistic forecast combines cloud variance + model
  residual in quadrature. v0.9.2 adds per-hour ensemble disagreement
  as a third quadrature term — when Open-Meteo and NWS disagree by
  20 pp on tomorrow noon's cloud cover, the P10/P90 band on that
  hour's PV widens by ~20% / Z10. **Disagreement IS the uncertainty
  signal** — Phoenix monsoon clouds are notoriously hard for any
  single global model, so when two independent models concur the
  forecast is trustworthy; when they don't, the band correctly
  reflects that.

### API

- **`/api/weather/ensemble`** — returns the full hourly forecast
  with per-hour `ensembleSources` (1 or 2) + `disagreementPct`.
  Summary fields: `sourcesCount`, `avgDisagreementPct`,
  `enrichedHourCount` / `hourCount`.

### UI

- New **"Weather ensemble"** section in the Advanced Insights card:
  source count, average disagreement, status indicator
  (tight bands / wide bands), and ensemble-coverage percentage.
  Hidden when only one source is active (NWS disabled or
  unreachable).

### Notes

- US-only — NWS doesn't cover other countries. Outside the US,
  set `NWS_ENABLED=0` and the panel transparently falls back to
  Open-Meteo only.
- The NWS gridpoint endpoint is `User-Agent`-gated; we send a
  descriptive UA per their TOS.
- Failures on the NWS side are non-fatal — Open-Meteo continues
  working alone, with a single log line noting the fall-through.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-05-24

Hotfix — actually ship the HACS card source committed in v0.9.0.

### Bug fix

- **`.gitignore` was eating `lovelace/dist/`.** The global `dist/`
  pattern that catches `web/dist` and `server/dist` (those ARE built
  artifacts) also caught `lovelace/dist/ecoflow-panel-card.js` (which
  is NOT — it's the source-of-truth, hand-written Web Component, no
  build step). v0.9.0's commit dropped the card silently. HACS would
  find `hacs.json` + `README.md` but `404` on the card itself.
- **Fix:** added `!lovelace/dist/` exception to `.gitignore`, committed
  the missing file. HACS install now works end-to-end.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-05-24

**Predictive Engine v2.5.** Three previously-deferred research-grade
features ship plus an HA-native UI surface plus a config-side-effect
cleanup. 5 features, 5 new tests, 0 vulnerabilities.

### Features

- **Bayesian recursive GHI→PV update.** Replaces the OLS-on-rolling-
  window approach with a proper conjugate Gaussian update per
  hour-of-day. Each new (GHI, PV) observation refines the posterior
  N(μ, τ²) on the response coefficient β via closed-form:

  ```
  1/τ'² = 1/τ² + g²/σ²
  μ'    = τ'² · (μ/τ² + g·p/σ²)
  ```

  Output: per-hour posterior mean + stdev + 95% credible interval.
  Side-by-side `agreementWithOls` field reports how often the OLS
  point estimate sits inside the Bayesian 1σ band — drift between
  the two flags model brittleness. New endpoint:
  `/api/forecast/bayesian`.
- **Kalman filter for pack SoH.** 2-state constant-velocity filter
  (state = [SoH, dSoH/dt]) over BMS-reported SoH observations.
  Operates internally in days to keep the dt² term in F·P·Fᵀ
  numerically conditioned. Process noise tuned so SoH drifts slowly
  and fade rate is near-constant; observation noise matches BMS's
  ±0.5% reporting jitter. Output: smoothed SoH + drift rate (%/yr)
  + uncertainty derived directly from posterior covariance — no
  t-statistic approximation. Available as `kalmanFilterSoh()`,
  ready to swap into `analysePack` in a follow-up (left out of the
  main projection path for v0.9.0 so we can compare its output
  against the existing OLS in real history before fully migrating).
- **PackRiskScore (heuristic-weighted v1).** NOT a trained ML
  model — we don't have a labeled dataset of pack failures, and
  shipping a half-trained model would be malpractice. Instead: a
  hand-tuned weighted combination of 6 engineered features (peer-
  fade ratio, internal-R trend, coulombic efficiency, thermal
  hard-life score, charge-curve drift, capacity fade rate). Each
  normalized to 0..1; weighted sum → sigmoid → 0..100 risk score.
  Tier: low / moderate / elevated / critical. Output includes the
  ranked **contributing factors** so the user can see exactly what's
  driving each pack's score. The output shape mirrors what a trained
  classifier would produce — `modelVersion: "heuristic-v1"` lets a
  future swap-in stay drop-in-compatible. New endpoint:
  `/api/pack-risk`.
- **HACS Lovelace card.** Self-contained Web Component (no Lit /
  framework dep) that lives under `lovelace/dist/`. Fetches
  `/api/ha-state` from the add-on, renders 12 headline numbers
  inside HA (PV / load / backup / runway / projected SoC / grid /
  PV-lifetime + CO2 / RTE / tariff savings / alerts / soonest EOL /
  clipped today) with status colour-coding, plus three action
  buttons: Open dashboard, Repair issues, Calendar feed. Packaged
  with `hacs.json` so HACS detects it as a Plugin-type repository.
  Manual install via `/local/` also documented. README under
  `lovelace/README.md` walks both install paths.

### Bug fix / hygiene

- **`config.ts` lazy-getter refactor.** Previously
  `accessKey: need('ECOFLOW_ACCESS_KEY')` threw at module-load time
  — any test/script that transitively imported `config.ts` would
  crash before doing anything else. v0.8.1's test gate caught this
  the first time it ran in CI; v0.8.2 patched with dummy env vars.
  v0.9.0 removes the root cause: `accessKey` and `secretKey` are now
  lazy getters that throw on FIRST ACCESS rather than at import. Any
  test/REPL/script context can import `config.ts` cleanly; the
  validation still fires loudly on first real use. The v0.8.2 CI
  env-var workaround is removed.

### Tests

- **5 new tests** for `kalmanFilterSoh`: returns null on insufficient
  data, recovers known slope from clean synthetic data, smoothed SoH
  tracks observations, uncertainty shrinks with more samples,
  doesn't diverge on noisy data.
- Total server tests: **41/41 passing**.

### API

New endpoints:
- `/api/forecast/bayesian` — Bayesian per-hour solar response model
  with credible intervals.
- `/api/pack-risk` — heuristic-weighted pack risk scores with
  contributing factors.

### Notes / what's explicitly NOT in v0.9.0

- **No trained ML model.** PackRiskScore is the framework + the
  heuristic surface. When a labeled failure dataset eventually
  exists (months/years out), swap the weighted-sum-+-sigmoid with
  a gradient-boosted tree and bump `modelVersion`.
- **Kalman not yet replacing OLS in `analysePack`.** The Kalman
  filter is exposed via `kalmanFilterSoh()` and tested, but
  `analysePack` still uses `linregress` to project EOL. Swap-in
  is planned for a follow-up release after side-by-side comparison
  on real Pi data confirms the Kalman gives equivalent-or-better
  projections.
- **HACS card is the "stats card", not a full dashboard rebuild.**
  Replicating the entire React dashboard in Lit/Web Components
  would be multi-week work for marginal benefit (the PWA already
  installs as a native app). The card is scoped to headline numbers
  + one-click to the PWA.

## 0.8.2 — 2026-05-24

Patch — fix the CI test job from v0.8.1.

### Bug fix

- **CI: provide dummy ECOFLOW credentials to the test job.** v0.8.1's
  test gate caught a real CI integration issue on its first run:
  two test files (`alertMonitor.test.ts`, `analytics.test.ts`)
  transitively import `src/config.ts`, which calls
  `need('ECOFLOW_ACCESS_KEY')` at module-load time and throws if the
  env var isn't set. Locally `.env` provides them; CI doesn't.
  Fix: set `ECOFLOW_ACCESS_KEY=test-access-key` /
  `ECOFLOW_SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key` in the test job env. The tests
  themselves never call the EcoFlow API — they exercise pure
  functions — so the placeholders are inert. **All 36 tests now pass
  in CI.**
- **TODO (future):** refactor `config.ts` so `accessKey` /
  `secretKey` use lazy getters that throw on first access rather
  than at import time. Eliminates this class of import-side-effect
  footgun for future test additions.

### Validation

- v0.8.1 release-pipeline run succeeded only as far as `Resolve
  version`; `Server tests` failed, and `Build & push` + `Cut GitHub
  Release` were correctly skipped (no broken image got pushed).
  Behaves exactly as the gate was designed.

## 0.8.1 — 2026-05-24

Polish patch — security fix, bundle splitting, and the first
automated tests in the codebase.

### Security

- **Bumped `@fastify/static` from `^8.0.4` → `^9.1.3`.** Fixes two
  Dependabot-reported moderate vulnerabilities:
  - GHSA-???-???-??? — path traversal in directory listing
  - GHSA-???-???-??? — route guard bypass via encoded path separators
  `npm audit` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**. Usage in the codebase
  is the minimal `register(fastifyStatic, { root, wildcard: false })`
  shape, so the major-version bump was a drop-in.

### Performance — route-level code splitting

Initial Dashboard bundle:

| | v0.8.0 | v0.8.1 | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial JS | 698.54 kB | **60.87 kB** | 11.5× smaller |
| Initial gzip | 202.62 kB | **17.62 kB** | 11.5× smaller |

`recharts` (~543 kB minified) split into a lazy vendor chunk that
only loads when the user visits a chart-heavy page (Solar, Battery,
EVSE, Strategy, Predictive). All non-Dashboard pages converted to
`React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>` so each loads on first navigation.
`TrendChart` lazy-loaded too (only loads when the user toggles
"show history" on the Dashboard).

### Tests

- **36 server-side unit tests** added under `server/test/`, run via
  Node 22's built-in `node:test` runner through `tsx` (no new
  runtime deps). Coverage:
  - `aggregator.test.ts` — `integrateWh` trapezoidal correctness, gap
    behavior, leading anchor, trailing extension, partial coverage,
    `startOfLocalDayMs`
  - `alertMonitor.test.ts` — `parseQuietHours` (valid/invalid/empty),
    `inQuietWindow` (non-wrapping and wrap-past-midnight),
    `buildIncidents` (pack-clustering, core-clustering, thermal-
    cascade naming, severity sorting)
  - `analytics.test.ts` — `rootCausesFor` graph traversal,
    `parseRange`, `onPeakAt` (TOU classification with weekday/weekend
    semantics), `forecastDayAlerts` (counterfactual cloud-cover fact,
    soiling threshold gating, no false positives on healthy forecast)
  - `calendar.test.ts` — RFC5545 envelope, line-folding, comma /
    semicolon escaping, EV-session events, SoC-dip events
- **`npm test` script** wired into `server/package.json`.
- **CI test job** added to `.github/workflows/images.yml` — runs
  `npm test` + `tsc --noEmit` on every release tag and **blocks the
  image build on test failure**.

### Bug fix found by tests

- **Calendar feed cache was un-keyed.** `buildCalendarIcs` had a
  module-level 5-min cache that locked the calendar content for the
  first 5 min regardless of input changes — any new SoC dip or NWS
  storm wouldn't appear until cache expiry. Removed the function-
  level cache; replaced with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` on
  the `/api/calendar.ics` HTTP response (correct architecture —
  upstream data sources already cache internally).

## 0.8.0 — 2026-05-24

"Big push" release — full HA-native integration surface + predictive
engine v2 (uncertainty-aware, multi-day, counterfactual, dispatch).
13 features in one release. Everything is **read-only** by explicit
user request — no write actions to EcoFlow devices in this release.

### Features — HA integration

- **Per-circuit lifetime kWh.** The persistent `lifetime_totals`
  accumulator from v0.7.6 now maintains one row per SHP2 circuit
  (`circuit_<ch>_wh`). Each circuit appears as its own
  `state_class: total_increasing` sensor under HA Energy
  Dashboard → **Individual devices** — water heater, EVSE, HVAC,
  pool pump, etc. broken out cleanly. MQTT Discovery auto-publishes
  one sensor per detected SHP2 circuit.
- **Carbon offset / sustainability reporting.** New
  `computeCarbonReport` multiplies PV-direct-to-load + battery
  discharge by the regional grid CO2 intensity (default 1100 lb/MWh
  for AZ; configurable via `GRID_CO2_INTENSITY_LB_PER_MWH`) to
  derive kg CO2 avoided. Equivalent miles-not-driven via the EPA
  passenger-car number. Surfaced as 4 new HA sensors:
  CO2 avoided (7d / lifetime), miles not driven (lifetime), grid
  intensity.
- **TOU tariff cost tracking.** Configurable on-peak / off-peak
  rates + hour-of-day windows + day-of-week mask
  (`TARIFF_ON_PEAK_CENTS`, `TARIFF_OFF_PEAK_CENTS`,
  `TARIFF_ON_PEAK_HOURS=15-20`, `TARIFF_ON_PEAK_DAYS=1-5`). Computes
  grid-import cost today + 7d, solar-load value (what the load
  would have cost from grid), net savings. APS-Saver-style defaults.
- **Calendar ICS feed** at `/api/calendar.ics` (RFC5545). HA's
  `generic_ics_calendar` integration can subscribe. Surfaces SHP2
  TOU charge windows, predicted EV charging sessions, projected
  SoC dips below reserve, active NWS storm windows — your
  EcoFlow events appear in any iOS / Google / HA calendar app.
- **Repair issues feed** at `/api/repair-issues`. Curated subset
  of alerts where the user can take physical action — wash panels,
  power-cycle zombie devices, inspect peer-outlier packs, etc.
  Each issue has stable id, severity, summary, ordered fix steps,
  and a category. Persistent first-seen tracking lets HA show
  "active for N hours".
- **Diagnostic entity recategorization.** Markers like `PV Array
  Peak Watts` now carry `entity_category: diagnostic` so they hide
  from the main HA UI but remain available for automations.

### Features — Predictive engine v2

- **Probabilistic forecasts (P10/P50/P90).** Replaces the single-
  line PV curve with a confidence band per hour. Variance sources:
  per-hour-of-day cloud-cover stdev (from history) + model residual
  fraction (forecast skill MAE). Combined in quadrature into a
  Gaussian-equivalent band; propagated into the SoC trajectory.
  Output: `/api/forecast/probabilistic` returns per-hour P10/P50/P90
  bands plus headline numbers: P(SoC stays above reserve through
  24 h), P(full charge), kWh stdev. Enables risk-aware automations
  rather than "trust the point estimate".
- **Multi-day forecast horizon (3 days).** Extends the 24 h horizon
  to 72 h with per-day rollups: PV kWh, load kWh, min projected
  SoC + ts. `/api/forecast/multi-day`. Lets you answer "should I
  run the dryer Wed or Sat?" or "will I make it to the weekend
  before the storm?".
- **Counterfactual alert explanations.** The `forecast-soc-dip`
  and `forecast-low-solar` alerts now include a `why` decomposition
  in their detail — cloud cover vs typical, hypothetical clear-sky
  ceiling, hours-modelled count. Stops being "X is wrong" and
  starts being "X is wrong BECAUSE Y".
- **Root-cause graph for alerts.** Hand-curated causal DAG mapping
  alert families to likely upstream causes (cell imbalance →
  thermal stress → fade rate; soiling → low forecast; etc.).
  `/api/root-cause?alertId=...` walks one hop back. AdvancedInsights
  card surfaces upstream candidates next to each alert.
- **Energy dispatch planner (compute-only).** Greedy 24 h hour-by-
  hour schedule given forecast PV, load, tariff, current SoC,
  reserve floor: charge from PV when surplus, discharge to load
  during on-peak hours, top off from grid during off-peak before
  the next peak. Output: recommended schedule + estimated savings
  vs all-grid baseline. **Compute-only — does NOT auto-apply** (user
  explicitly held write actions). Mirror manually via the EcoFlow
  mobile app or HA automations.

### Features — PWA

- **PWA installable.** Web UI now ships a `manifest.webmanifest` +
  service worker. Add-to-Home-Screen on iOS / Android / desktop
  Chrome works cleanly — your panel launches as a standalone app
  with no browser chrome. Static shell is stale-while-revalidate
  cached; `/api` and `/ws` traffic always hits the network so
  telemetry stays live. Custom-themed icon (sun-over-battery on
  dashboard slate).

### API

- **New endpoints:** `/api/carbon`, `/api/tariff`,
  `/api/forecast/probabilistic`, `/api/forecast/multi-day`,
  `/api/dispatch-plan`, `/api/root-cause`, `/api/calendar.ics`,
  `/api/repair-issues`.
- **`/api/ha-state`** gains 12+ new fields: per-circuit lifetime
  kWh (one per SHP2 circuit), 4 carbon fields, 7 tariff fields.
- **MQTT Discovery** publishes 6 new aggregate sensors (CO2, miles,
  costs, savings) + dynamically generates one Energy-Dashboard
  sensor per SHP2 circuit on connect.

### Docs

- DOCS.md walkthrough for: TOU tariff config, NWS opt-in, MQTT
  Discovery setup, HA Energy Dashboard hookup (5+ slots), repair-
  issues consumption, calendar subscription, PWA install on iOS.

### Notes / explicitly deferred

User held all write-to-device features for a later release. Also
deferred to v1.0+ (genuine multi-week research scope, would be
malpractice to half-ship in a single batch):

- Bayesian GHI→PV update (replacing OLS with proper posterior)
- Kalman state-space SoC/SoH estimator
- ML failure-mode classifier (needs training infrastructure)
- Self-tuning anomaly z-score thresholds
- HACS Lovelace frontend card (full Web Components rebuild)
- LAN-direct EcoFlow protocol (reverse engineering)
- Multi-site federation (requires backend infra)

These remain on the roadmap and will be tackled in a focused way
when they're the priority. For now: v0.8.0 ships the read-only
side of the v2.0 roadmap.

## 0.7.7 — 2026-05-24

Diagnostics patch — actionable offline alerts plus per-SN connectivity
logging so the next "why is X offline" investigation is one log grep,
not a code spelunk.

### Features

- **Cloud-session-stale alert.** Track `lastDeviceListAttemptAt` and
  `lastDeviceListSuccessAt` separately in the snapshot store. When
  attempts continue but the most recent success was > 5 min ago,
  fire a top-level "EcoFlow Cloud session stale" warning explaining
  that all per-device online/offline indicators below reflect the
  last successful poll, NOT current state. Stops misleading the user
  into power-cycling devices when the issue is the cloud session.
- **Enriched offline-device alert.** What used to be
  `"<device> is not reporting to EcoFlow"` now reads
  `"<device> is flagged offline by EcoFlow's /device/list. We
  previously received N MQTT message(s) this session; last data 47
  min ago via MQTT. The device is likely in the 'EcoFlow zombie'
  state — connected to LAN but MQTT TCP session wedged. Power-cycle
  the device to force a clean reconnect."` Three facts attached:
  reported-by, last-data (with source: MQTT/REST + age), MQTT
  msg-count. Action hint scales to the data-age (just dropped /
  stale-but-recent / 30+ min zombie).
- **Per-SN state-transition logging.** `setDeviceList` and
  `setDeviceOnline` (in `snapshot.ts`) now emit one info-level log
  line on every online/offline transition: `device-list: Core 4
  (Y7…) → OFFLINE per EcoFlow Cloud`. First-sight inaugural state
  is also logged. Diagnosed from the user's 10k-line log audit
  where zero such lines existed and the cause had to be inferred.
- **Periodic fleet-status dump.** Every 10 min, one log line summarising
  every device's online state + MQTT msg-count + age since last data:
  `fleet-status [device-list last success 23s ago]: SHP2=ON/4521msg/3s
  · Core 1=ON/8210msg/2s · Core 4=OFF/0msg/∞ · …`. Makes "which
  device stopped reporting and when" answerable from a grep alone.

### Notes

- No new env vars; nothing to configure. The Cloud-session-stale
  alert uses a fixed 5-min threshold (twice the default 60 s poll
  interval), and the fleet-status dump is on by default at 10 min
  cadence (cheap, one log line per dump).
- The "EcoFlow zombie" pattern (device alive on LAN but cloud says
  offline) is genuinely an EcoFlow-side issue — there's nothing we
  can do to fix it from the panel side. But the new alert text now
  says so directly, with a power-cycle hint, instead of a generic
  "is not reporting" that left the user wondering whether to debug
  the dashboard or the device.

## 0.7.6 — 2026-05-24

Patch + feature — full **Home Assistant Energy Dashboard** integration.

### Features

- **Persistent lifetime energy counters.** New `lifetime_totals` table
  inside `/data/ecoflow.db` accumulates integrated Wh per metric under a
  watermark — every 5 min we integrate `(watermark, now]` from the
  rolling 30-day `samples` table, add the result to the persisted Wh,
  then advance the watermark. Pruning of raw samples can't decrement the
  counter; a server restart can't decrement it (boot seeds the floor
  from the persisted row); a transient negative sample can't decrement
  it (clamped at zero). Five counters maintained:
  - `fleet_pv_wh` — sum of every DPU's `pv_total` watts integrated over time
  - `fleet_load_wh` — SHP2 `panel_load` watts integrated
  - `fleet_grid_import_wh` — sum of grid-tied DPUs' `ac_in` watts integrated
  - `fleet_battery_charge_wh` — sourced directly from the **BMS
    `accuChgMah` lifetime counters** across all packs, converted to Wh
    at 102.4 V nominal. Authoritative since pack manufacture.
  - `fleet_battery_discharge_wh` — same from `accuDsgMah`.
- **HA Energy Dashboard wiring.** Five new sensors with
  `state_class: total_increasing` + `device_class: energy` so Home
  Assistant can ingest them into the Energy Dashboard's hourly /
  daily / monthly statistics: PV Production, Home Consumption, Grid
  Import (lifetime), Battery Energy In, Battery Energy Out.

### API

- **`/api/lifetime-energy`** — returns the five lifetime kWh values
  plus a `details` block exposing `persistedWh` + `pendingWh` +
  `watermarkMs` per metric (useful for diagnosing the rollup).
- **`/api/ha-state`** gains 5 new lifetime kWh fields:
  `pv_lifetime_kwh`, `load_lifetime_kwh`, `grid_import_lifetime_kwh`,
  `battery_charge_lifetime_kwh`, `battery_discharge_lifetime_kwh`.

### MQTT Discovery

- 5 additional auto-discovered sensors when
  `MQTT_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=1` is set — the Energy Dashboard slots fill
  themselves with no YAML edits.

### Docs

- New **HA Energy Dashboard** subsection in `DOCS.md` walks through
  the Settings → Dashboards → Energy hookup (one sensor per slot)
  and documents the persistence design + reset semantics.

### Notes

- The recorder's existing 30-day retention on raw samples is
  unchanged — `lifetime_totals` is a separate, lightweight, never-
  pruned table (one row per metric).
- On first install, the watermark seeds 60 s before boot so the
  initial rollup doesn't try to integrate years of empty history;
  numbers grow from there as live data arrives.
- The `close()` shutdown path now does a final rollup before closing
  the DB so we don't lose the trailing minute of energy.

## 0.7.5 — 2026-05-24

The "drain the roadmap" release. Every remaining roadmap item from
v0.7.0 + v0.8.0+ + external/infrastructure is shipped here in a single
batch — 17 features across analytics, alerting, and integration.
Pre-existing functionality is unchanged; everything new is purely
additive (new endpoints, new optional modules, one new card on the
Predictive Insights page).

### Features — Anomaly engine v2 (finish)

- **Alert clustering ("incidents").** Simultaneous alerts on the same
  Core / Pack are grouped into one Incident with one notification —
  a "Core 3 thermal cascade" with 5 contributing alerts now fires
  once, not five times. The Incident keeps every member alert ID so
  the detailed view still drills down. Exposed via new
  `/api/incidents` and surfaced in the v0.7.5 Advanced Insights card.
- **Internal-resistance trending.** `dV/dI ≈ effective R` derived
  from snapshot pairs of bus voltage + bus current (≥ 5 A swing, ≤ 60 s
  apart). Per-Core (DPU-level) tracking — recent vs baseline mΩ and a
  trend rate per month. Rising R precedes SoH decay by months on LFP.
  `/api/internal-resistance`.

### Features — Sharper forecasts

- **Forecast-skill calibration.** Hindcast: apply the learned solar
  model coefficients to the past 7 days of GHI to derive "what the
  model would have predicted" and compare with what actually happened
  per day. Reports MAE (kWh and %), bias factor (sum(actual) ÷
  sum(predicted)), and a per-day breakdown — bias factor is the
  correction the user can apply to today's forecast.
  `/api/forecast-skill`.
- **Ambient-coupled thermal forecast.** Two-variable least-squares
  regression of pack temperature against outdoor temperature + recent
  load. Predicts each pack's peak temperature in the next 24 h with
  an R² fit quality, using Open-Meteo's hourly tempC forecast.
  Surfaces "Core 3 Pack 2 will hit 108 °F tomorrow at 3 PM" before
  it happens. `/api/ambient-thermal-forecast`.

### Features — Insights requiring accumulated history

- **Shade-event detection.** Walks clear-sky hours across 45 days of
  history, builds a per-hour reference coefficient from the 90th-
  percentile of observed-PV ÷ GHI ratios, and flags hours whose
  recurring shortfall vs that reference exceeds 18% — physical
  obstruction, not weather. Annualised kWh-loss estimate.
  `/api/shade-report`.
- **Soiling decomposition.** Splits the existing fleet-wide soiling
  drop% per-DPU (each device drifts independently) and per-hour-of-day
  (some hours are more affected — e.g. east-facing morning sun).
  Answers "wash everything vs just the east-facing run?". `/api/soiling-decomposition`.
- **String mismatch / per-DPU production.** Compares each DPU's
  per-hour median PV to the fleet median for the same hour. Robust
  median + MAD + modified-z flags persistent underperformers — string
  mismatch, shaded panel, failing optimizer. `/api/string-mismatch`.
- **EV-charging window prediction.** Scans SHP2 paired-circuit
  history (where the EVSE lives) for sustained ≥ 2 kW sessions ≥ 30
  min, buckets by (weekday, start-hour), requires ≥ 3 recurrences to
  declare a pattern. Projects next 24 h. `/api/ev-window-prediction`.
- **Charge-curve fingerprinting.** Records `pack${N}_vol_max_mv` at
  SoC checkpoints (40 / 60 / 80 / 95 %) during *active charge*
  (`pack${N}_in > 100 W`), then compares today's medians against a
  baseline laid down in the first 14 days of recording. Mean drift in
  mV per pack — catches aging that SoH lags by months. `/api/charge-curve`.

### Features — External / infrastructure

- **NWS storm-preparedness signal.** Opt-in (`NWS_ENABLED=1`,
  US-only). Pulls active alerts.weather.gov alerts within ~50 mi of
  the configured forecast coordinates. Severe events (Tornado,
  Severe Thunderstorm, Hurricane, Excessive Heat, …) emit a
  learned-warning recommending pre-charge to 100% before onset.
  `/api/nws-alerts`.
- **Thermal-event counter.** Cumulative per-pack count of rising-edge
  crossings of three temperature thresholds (96 / 113 / 131 °F) with
  hysteresis so a sustained spell counts as one event. Tracks total
  hours-above-threshold per band and a "hard-life score" (1×warm +
  4×hot + 16×overheat, per year) that's directly comparable across
  packs with different recording histories. `/api/thermal-events`.
- **MPPT efficiency drift + inverter standby losses.** Per-string
  (HV + LV) per-Core: V·A vs reported W ratio (clamped to a sane
  band), recent median vs earliest-30%-of-history median, and a drift
  in percentage points. Inverter standby: ac_out residual when PV
  and panel load are both < 20 W; reports recent idle watts, baseline,
  and a weekly trend. Both in `/api/equipment-health`.
- **Confidence trends.** R² aggregator across the panel's main
  projections (degradation fade, solar response model, ambient
  thermal forecast) plus the forecast-skill bias factor and MAE %.
  Single endpoint snapshot: `/api/confidence`.
- **Notification timing intelligence.** Quiet-hours window
  (`NOTIFY_QUIET_HOURS=22-06` by default) queues warning + info
  alerts during the configured nighttime band; critical alerts
  always go through. At `NOTIFY_DIGEST_HOUR` (default 7) a single
  morning digest fires with the queued list. No more
  "you have 12 notifications about a brief cloud blip at 3 AM".
- **Alert-action telemetry.** Per-alert-ID rise count, longest
  duration, median duration, and short-clear fraction (cleared
  within 10 min). Info-severity alerts that rise ≥ 5 times AND
  short-clear in ≥ 70% of cases get auto-downgraded (silenced).
  `/api/alert-telemetry`.
- **Self-consumption ratio.** Rolling 7-day breakdown of PV
  generation, household load, battery in/out, grid import, and
  the derived solar fraction of load (% of consumption met by
  solar directly or via battery) and direct-use ratio (PV that
  went straight to load). `/api/self-consumption`.
- **MQTT discovery for HA entities.** Opt-in
  (`MQTT_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=1` + `MQTT_DISCOVERY_HOST`). Connects to
  the user's HA MQTT broker (e.g. the official `core-mosquitto`
  add-on), publishes 23 sensor + 1 binary_sensor `homeassistant/...`
  discovery topics with full device-info grouping, and pushes one
  big retained state JSON every 30 s. Drops the YAML-snippet
  requirement entirely for users who already run an MQTT broker.

### API

Fifteen new endpoints — one per feature surface:
`/api/self-consumption`, `/api/thermal-events`,
`/api/equipment-health`, `/api/shade-report`,
`/api/soiling-decomposition`, `/api/string-mismatch`,
`/api/ev-window-prediction`, `/api/charge-curve`,
`/api/internal-resistance`, `/api/forecast-skill`,
`/api/ambient-thermal-forecast`, `/api/confidence`,
`/api/nws-alerts`, `/api/incidents`, `/api/alert-telemetry`.

`/api/ha-state` gains 7 new fields covering self-consumption.

### UI

- New **AdvancedInsightsCard** added to the bottom of the
  Predictive Insights page — one section per analytics family,
  hides sections that have nothing to show yet. Fetches 14
  endpoints on a 60 s interval.

### Docs

- `DOCS.md` HA REST-sensor snippet gains 7 new sensors for the
  self-consumption + clipping numbers. Includes an MQTT-discovery
  setup note covering the opt-in env vars.
- README roadmap collapses: every v0.7.0, v0.8.0+, and
  external/infrastructure item is now shipped. Only WAVE 2 / Smart
  Generator schemas remain in the "Standing" section (blocked on
  EcoFlow shipping the IoT Open API spec).

### Notes

- Every new analytics function is **off the hot path** (cached
  5 – 60 min) and **silently degrades** when its prerequisites are
  missing (no weather, no history, no MQTT broker). No new
  required configuration — every opt-in feature ships off by default.
- MQTT discovery and NWS use `undici`/`mqtt` modules already in
  the dependency tree. No new runtime dependencies.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-05-24

Half-the-roadmap batch — four learned-analytics features tightened
around battery longevity, day-ahead forecasting accuracy, and
identifying solar capacity left on the table.

### Features — Anomaly engine v2

- **Per-circuit baseline anomaly detection.** Until now, each SHP2
  circuit's watts contributed to the panel total but had no
  self-baseline of its own — only paired (split-phase) totals and
  fleet-aggregate metrics had learned baselines. v0.6.0 wires every
  *unpaired* SHP2 circuit into the learned-baseline engine, so an
  individual outlet, freezer, well pump, or office sub-panel that
  starts pulling well outside its own median can fire a learned
  warning. Paired-circuit aggregates already cover the split-phase
  loads (water heater, AC, EV charger), so the per-circuit pass skips
  any channel that's part of a pair to avoid double-counting.

### Features — Forecasting accuracy

- **Day-of-week-aware load curve.** The day-ahead forecast used to
  collapse all weekday and weekend hours into a single hour-of-day
  average — but EV charging, dishwasher / laundry cycles, and
  home-office HVAC duty run on visibly different schedules Mon–Fri
  vs Sat–Sun. The new `hourCurveByWeekday` helper splits the typical
  load into a 24-hour weekday curve and a 24-hour weekend curve;
  `getDayForecast` picks the appropriate curve for each *projected*
  hour. Requires ≥ 24 hourly samples on both sides before the split
  is trusted; otherwise it falls back to the combined curve so a
  fresh install doesn't get whiplash.

### Features — Battery longevity v3

- **Per-pack coulombic efficiency.** Discharge mAh ÷ charge mAh over
  a rolling 7-day window, using the BMS lifetime counters
  (`pack${N}_lifetime_chg_mah`, `pack${N}_lifetime_dsg_mah`). Healthy
  LFP stays well above 99%; a downward drift signals side-reaction
  losses inside a cell that SoH alone may not yet show, and is an
  independent early-warning channel for cell degradation. Surfaced
  as a new fact tile in every pack's expanded view inside the
  degradation card.

### Features — Solar capacity

- **Inverter clipping quantifier.** New `computeClipping` analytics
  function estimates kWh-lost-to-clipping today by walking each
  elapsed daylight hour: an hour is flagged as "at peak" when
  observed PV reaches 95% of the hardware ceiling (highest hourly
  average PV ever observed across the fleet); if the learned
  GHI→PV model says the array could have produced more than what we
  recorded that hour, the difference is the clipped energy. Sum
  across the day → kWh lost to clipping today. The current hour is
  prorated by elapsed fraction. Cached 5 min.

### API

- **`/api/clipping`** — `ClippingEstimate` (today-kWh-lost,
  per-hour breakdown, array peak watts, hours-at-peak).
- **`/api/ha-state`** gains `pv_clipped_kwh_today`,
  `pv_array_peak_watts`, `pv_hours_at_peak_today`.

### Docs / roadmap

- DOCS.md HA snippet adds three new sensors (clipped-kWh-today,
  array-peak-watts, hours-at-peak-today). Total: 20 sensors + 1
  binary_sensor.
- README roadmap: removes the four shipped items, promotes the
  remaining anomaly-engine work (alert clustering) and the sharper-
  forecasts items (forecast-skill calibration) into the v0.7.0
  bucket.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-05-23

Patch fix — web UI / API now binds dual-stack, mirroring v0.3.1's telnet fix.

- `config.ts` + run script: changed the Fastify `HOST` default from
  `0.0.0.0` (IPv4 only) to `::` (Node dual-stack). macOS resolves
  `homeassistant.local` to both an IPv4 and several IPv6 addresses with
  IPv6 listed first; browser happy-eyeballs would race both, the IPv6
  connect would RST against the unbound v6 listener inside the
  add-on's port mapping, and `http://homeassistant.local:8787/` would
  stall or fail. Verified `curl -6 http://homeassistant.local:8787/api/health`
  returned HTTP 000 in ~13ms (TCP RST) while `-4` returned HTTP 200.
  With `::`, both protocols land on the same Fastify listener.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-05-23

### Features — Battery longevity v2

- **Temperature-corrected SoH fade (Arrhenius).** Each projecting or
  stable pack now reports `avgPackTempC` (across the SoH regression
  window), the resulting Arrhenius factor, the **calendar fade
  re-expressed at the 25 °C reference**, and an estimated
  **years-of-life-gained-if-cooled-5 °C** number. Three new fact-tiles
  per pack in the degradation card; the per-pack summary sentence
  appends the Arrhenius note when the data supports it. Direct answer
  to "would moving these to a cooler garage save me X years?" for
  Phoenix-class climates.

- **Round-trip efficiency, rolling 7-day.** Integrates per-pack input
  vs output watts across all DPUs over the last 7 days; ratio shows in
  a new tile on the degradation-card header and as the
  `ecoflow_round_trip_efficiency` HA sensor. Healthy LFP sits 95–97%;
  a slow drift down is the cleanest "the whole stack is aging" signal
  that no single-pack metric catches. Cached 5 min.

### Features — Operational

- **Live off-grid runway.** New prominent card at the top of the
  Dashboard: hours to reserve and hours to empty, projected hour-by-hour
  from the last-hour panel load and the next-24-hour forecast PV.
  Headline colour shifts **red < 4h / amber < 12h / neutral ≥ 12h**.
  Also surfaces the clock times ("Reserve floor reached around Sat
  9 PM") and a breakdown of the assumptions (backup now, reserve floor,
  recent load, forecast PV vs load over the horizon). Exposed as
  `ecoflow_runway_to_reserve_hours` and `ecoflow_runway_to_empty_hours`
  HA sensors. Cached 60 s.

### API

- **`/api/runway`** — RunwayProjection.
- **`/api/round-trip-efficiency?days=N`** — RoundTripEfficiency (days
  capped 1–30, default 7).
- **`/api/ha-state`** gains `runway_to_reserve_hours`,
  `runway_to_empty_hours`, `runway_recent_load_watts`,
  `runway_forecast_pv_used_kwh`, `round_trip_efficiency_percent`,
  `round_trip_charged_kwh_7d`, `round_trip_discharged_kwh_7d`.

### Docs / roadmap

- DOCS.md HA snippet adds three new sensors (runway-to-reserve,
  runway-to-empty, round-trip-efficiency). Total: 17 sensors + 1
  binary_sensor.
- README roadmap expanded to a multi-release plan (v0.6.0 anomaly
  engine v2, v0.7.0 sharper forecasts, v0.8.0+ pattern detection with
  history, plus external-integration and standing buckets).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-23

### Features

- **Per-circuit multi-day kWh comparison on the circuit modal.** Click
  any SHP2 circuit on the Dashboard → in addition to the live "now",
  "peak (24h)", "average (24h)", "today" tiles and the 24h watt chart,
  there's a new **Last 7 days** panel: a bar chart of daily kWh totals
  for the past week, with **today highlighted in accent** as a partial /
  running total, the **peak day color-coded amber**, days with no data
  rendered dim, and a **dashed reference line at the 7-day average**.
  Hovering any bar shows that day's total kWh, peak watts, when the
  peak hit, and a "partial day" caveat for incomplete windows. Three
  summary tiles below the chart: average per day (with "N/7 days w/
  data" coverage note), peak day, and quietest day.

- **New `/api/circuit/history?sn=<SN>&ch=<N>&days=<N>` endpoint.**
  Returns per-day trapezoidal kWh + peak watts + peak timestamp +
  coverage, plus a summary block (average, peak day, min day). Day
  windows are local-midnight to next local-midnight (or `now` for the
  in-progress day). Days capped at 30 to keep recorder queries bounded;
  default is 7.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-05-23

Patch fix for the telnet TUI over `homeassistant.local`.

- **Telnet binds dual-stack** — changed the `TELNET_HOST` default from
  `0.0.0.0` (IPv4 only) to `::` (Node dual-stack: listens on both IPv4
  and IPv6 on one socket; Node leaves `IPV6_V6ONLY` off so IPv4 clients
  still connect via mapped addresses). macOS resolves
  `homeassistant.local` to both an IPv4 and several IPv6 addresses with
  IPv6 listed first; `getaddrinfo` (which `nc`/`telnet`/`python socket`
  all use) picks IPv6, so `nc homeassistant.local 2323` was reaching the
  HA host's IPv6 stack — which had no listener for the add-on's port —
  and the TCP handshake completed only to be immediately RST'd
  ("Connection reset by peer"). The IPv4 path always worked
  (`nc -4 hostname`, or `nc <IP>`) but it wasn't discoverable. With `::`,
  both protocols land on the same telnet listener.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-23

### Features

- **Home Assistant entities integration** — new `/api/ha-state` endpoint
  returns a flat key-value JSON designed for HA's `rest:` integration. One
  HTTP call surfaces ~13 sensors + 1 binary_sensor (backup pool %, panel
  load, AC import, off-grid status, day-ahead forecast, soonest-EOL pack,
  alert counts, peer-outlier count, etc.). Forecast + degradation are
  reused from their internal caches, so HA polling every 30s is
  essentially free. See `DOCS.md` → "Home Assistant entities" for the
  copy-pasteable `configuration.yaml` snippet and example automations
  (backup-pool-low, critical-alert, projected-SoC-dip).

### Chores

- `dependabot.yml`: ignore major version bumps. The first batch of
  Dependabot PRs was all majors (React 18→19, Tailwind 3→4, TS 5→6,
  Vite 6→8, Fastify ecosystem majors, Node 22→26) — each one needed
  deliberate migration work, none was auto-mergeable. All seven closed;
  going forward only minor/patch updates auto-PR.

- README: moved "HA service integration" from Roadmap to Phase 7
  (shipped). Dropped the "Pre-built multi-arch GHCR images" roadmap line
  (shipped in Phase 6). New roadmap entry: MQTT discovery for HA
  entities, to auto-register sensors without a YAML snippet.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-05-22

Runtime fix for the start crash loop.

- `config.yaml`: added `init: false`. HA's `init: true` default wraps the
  container with Docker's tini, making tini PID 1. The HA base image
  already ships its own s6-overlay `/init`; with tini in front, the
  base's `s6-overlay-suexec` saw it wasn't PID 1 and refused to start,
  producing the crash-loop log:
  ```
  s6-overlay-suexec: fatal: can only run as pid 1
  ```
  Setting `init: false` disables tini so our `/init` (s6) runs as PID 1 —
  the standard pattern for any add-on built on the official HA base
  images.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-05-22

Schema fix for the Configuration → Save flow.

- `config.yaml`: relaxed the schema for `NOTIFY_NTFY_SERVER` and
  `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` from `url?` to `str?`. Voluptuous (HA's schema
  validator) treats `url?` as "may be absent **or** a valid URL" — but
  both fields ship with empty defaults that only get filled when the
  matching `NOTIFY_CHANNEL` is in use. With the strict `url?` type, the
  first **Save** always failed with `Failed to save: expected a URL.
  Got {…}` (voluptuous dumps the whole options dict instead of the
  failing path). The runtime notify code validates each URL at the
  moment it actually uses the channel, so the schema relaxation is safe.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-05-22

Patch fix for two issues that hit on the first `v0.2.0` push.

- **Dockerfile multi-stage ARG**: moved `ARG BUILD_FROM` (and the other
  `BUILD_*` args) to the **global scope** (above every `FROM`) so the
  runtime stage's `FROM ${BUILD_FROM}` substitutes correctly. Declared
  inside the previous stage, `BUILD_FROM` was scoped to that stage and
  evaluated to empty in the runtime `FROM`, so the docker smoke build
  (CI) and `Publish images` (on tag) both failed instantly with
  `ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: base name (${BUILD_FROM})
  should not be blank`.
- **`server/src/telnet/server.ts`**: cast the socket `data` event payload
  to `Buffer` at the call site. `@types/node` ≥ 22.19 narrowed the event
  payload to `string | Buffer`, and the inner `onData(data: Buffer)`
  signature rejected the union. (Local working tree had `@types/node@22.10`
  cached, so it only surfaced when CI's fresh `npm ci` pulled the latest
  patch.) The runtime never sets a socket encoding, so the cast is
  type-only — no behavior change.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-22

### Distribution
- **Pre-built multi-arch images on GHCR** (aarch64 + amd64). Installing this
  version on the Pi pulls a ready-made image instead of building the
  container from source — install time drops from minutes to seconds, and
  the Pi stops having to do `npm ci` over a slow connection.
- `config.yaml` now declares
  `image: ghcr.io/tesseractaz/{arch}-ecoflow-panel`; HA Supervisor substitutes
  `{arch}` with the host's CPU architecture.

### CI / release pipeline
- **Docker smoke build in CI** (`ci.yml`) — every push and PR builds the
  container (amd64, cached) so a broken Dockerfile is caught before it
  reaches the Pi.
- **Split release flow** — `release.yml` cuts the tag and pushes; the new
  `images.yml` workflow takes over on tag push, builds + pushes amd64 and
  aarch64 images to GHCR in parallel, then creates the GitHub Release. **The
  Release appearing on GitHub is now the "go ahead and update" signal.**
- **Dependabot** configured for npm (server + web), GitHub Actions, and the
  Dockerfile base images — weekly Monday PRs, grouped by production /
  development to cut PR noise.

### Notes
- One-time setup after the first `images.yml` run: open
  <https://github.com/tesseractAZ?tab=packages>, find `amd64-ecoflow-panel` and
  `aarch64-ecoflow-panel`, and change each from Private → Public so HA
  Supervisor can pull anonymously.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-22

Initial Home Assistant add-on release. Packages the existing EcoFlow Panel app
(Fastify + Vite/React + telnet TUI) as a single supervised container that runs
on a Raspberry Pi or any 64-bit Home Assistant host.

### Features
- **Live dashboard** at `http://<ha-host>:8787/` — energy-flow diagram, today's
  totals, day-ahead forecast, per-DPU detail, SHP2 backup pool + circuits.
- **Solar page** — fleet PV, per-DPU MPPT HV/LV detail, equipment-tuned
  response model, 24h production chart. Renders 10-panel HV + 4-panel LV
  strings per array DPU.
- **Battery page** — fleet pack table, hottest-pack flag, full per-pack thermal
  and electrical detail.
- **Predictive Insights** — anomalies (peer-comparison, self-baseline),
  forecast alerts (runtime, low-solar, low-SoC dip, soiling), and a deep
  per-pack **capacity-fade → end-of-life projection** with regression-derived
  confidence band, cycle intensity, fade-per-100-cycles, lifetime throughput,
  and a fleet peer-outlier flag.
- **Telnet control-room TUI** on port 2323 — 9 screens, NAWS-adaptive, with
  the same EOL projection surfaced inline on the Battery screen.
- **Alerts & history** — threshold + learned alerts, cleared-anomaly log
  persisted in memory, optional **ntfy / Pushover / webhook** push notifications.
- **Persistence** — SQLite history at `/data/ecoflow.db` on HA's persistent
  volume; survives add-on rebuilds and host updates.

### Configuration
- All EcoFlow / MQTT / notification / weather settings exposed as typed
  HA add-on Options — no `.env` editing on the Pi.

### Supported architectures
- `aarch64` — Raspberry Pi 4 / Pi 5 on 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (the
  modern default), and any other ARM64 HA host.
- `amd64` — for x86 HA hosts and testing.
